      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The use of digital twins in offshore wind farms presents a major opportunity to advance autonomous operations and optimize productivity. By creating virtual replicas of physical assets and systems, digital twins allow for real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and efficient decision-making. In the context of Industry 4.0, wind turbines are required not only to be remotely monitored and controlled through real-time data during operation, but also to manage the whole life cycle within the entire value chain. To accomplish this, the implementation of digital twin frameworks in accordance with Industry 4.0 standards is crucial. Motivated by the advanced technologies related to industrial digital twins in the context of Industry 4.0 implemented in the manufacturing sector, this paper presents findings from a study investigating the potential for transferring knowledge of industrial digital twins to offshore wind farm context. To gain a deeper understanding of the digital twin concept in the context of offshore wind applications, we conducted extensive literature studies. Specifically, we examined frameworks used in both the manufacturing industry and offshore wind industry. Our goal is to identify commonalities and differences between these frameworks, and to determine how they could be adapted to the unique requirements of the offshore wind sector. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which is a key concept of the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), provides a standardized and modular approach to representing and managing assets in industrial systems. By adopting AAS, offshore wind farms could improve the scalability, adaptability, and interoperability of their digital twin systems, and also enable more efficient and effective operation and maintenance of the turbines. Based on our findings, we concluded that implementing the AAS could be a promising option for enhancing the functionality of digital twins in offshore wind farms, and for achieving interoperability in line with the standards of Industry 4.0.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The fire weather index (FWI) is a widely used metric for fire danger based on meteorological observations. However, due to its empirical formulation based on a specific regional relationship between the meteorological observations and fire intensity, the ability of the FWI to accurately represent global satellite-derived fire intensity observations is limited. In this study, we propose a fire parameterization method using feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) for individual grids. These FFNNs for each grid point utilize four daily meteorological variables (2-meter relative humidity (RH2m), precipitation, 2-meter temperature, and wind speed) as inputs. The outputs of the FFNNs are satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) values. Applying the proposed FFNNs for fire parameterization during the 2001&ndash;2020 period revealed a marked enhancement in cross-validated skill compared to parameterization solely based on the FWI. This improvement was particularly notable across East Asia, Russia, the eastern US, southern South America, and central Africa. The sensitivity experiments demonstrated that the RH2m is the most critical variable in estimating the FRP and its regional differences via the FFNNs. Conversely, the FWI-based estimations were primarily influenced by precipitation. The FFNNs accurately captured the observed nonlinear correlations between FRP and RH2m, as well as precipitation. In contrast, FWI-based estimations exhibit an excessively negative relationship between FRP and precipitation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The convective heavy precipitation events, which occur primarily in the summer months, cannot be recorded representatively by ground-based precipitation stations due to their frequently small spatial extent, short life span and high rapidly changing intensity. The radar network of the German Weather Service, on the other hand, records area-wide, spatiotemporally highly resolved precipitation information that enables comprehensive identification of precipitation objects. In this study, a method for the identification, description and classification of convective precipitation objects considering a flood-relevant event extent is presented. Assuming an orographic independence of the events in the Central European low mountain range, the German State of Hesse is chosen as representative study area. Considering the spatial and temporal extent of the identified events, the most extreme expression is selected and independence is ensured. With the assignment of an authoritative duration for the intensive main rainfall phase, an extensive collection of heavy precipitation objects results. The results show a characteristic event length of 15 to 60 minutes; longer durations are underrepresented and exhibit inhomogeneous extreme value behavior. Statistically, the generated samples can be well represented and classified by the generalized extreme value distribution. The evaluation allows us to make a regional characterization of convective heavy precipitation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The hydroxyl radical (OH) largely determines the atmosphere&rsquo;s oxidative capacity and, thus, the lifetimes of numerous trace gases, including methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Hitherto, observation-based approaches for estimating the atmospheric oxidative capacity have primarily relied on using methyl chloroform (MCF), but as the atmospheric abundance of MCF has declined, the uncertainties associated with this method have increased. In this study, we examine the use of five hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (HFC-134a, HFC-152a, HFC-365mfc, HFC-245fa and HFC-32) in multi-species inversions, which assimilate three HFCs simultaneously, as an alternative method to estimate atmospheric OH. We find robust estimates of OH regardless of which combination of three HFCs are used in the inversions. Our results show that OH has remained fairly stable during our study period from 2004 to 2021, with variations of &lt;2 % and no significant trend. Inversions including HFC-32 and HFC-152a (the shortest-lived species) indicate a small reduction in OH in 2020 (1.6 % &plusmn; 0.9 % relative to the mean over 2004&ndash;2021 and 0.6 &plusmn; 0.9 % lower than in 2019), but considering all inversions, the reduction was only 0.5 &plusmn; 1.1 % and OH was at a similar level to that in 2019.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>We evaluate two high-resolution Lake Michigan air quality simulations during the 2017 Lake Michigan Ozone Study campaign. These air quality simulations employ identical chemical configurations but use different input meteorology. The AP-XM configuration follows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-recommended modeling practices, whereas the YNT_SSNG employs different parameterization schemes and satellite-based inputs of sea surface temperatures, green vegetative fraction, and soil moisture and temperature. Overall, we find a similar performance in the model simulations of hourly and maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) ozone, with the AP-XM and YNT_SSNG simulations showing biases of <span class="inline-formula">−11.42</span> and <span class="inline-formula">−13.54</span> ppbv (parts per billion by volume), respectively, during periods when the observed MDA8 was greater than 70 ppbv. However, for the two monitoring sites that observed high-ozone events, the AP-XM simulation better matched observations at Chiwaukee Prairie, and the YNT_SSNG simulation better matched observations at the Sheboygan Kohler-Andrae (KA) State Park. We find that the differences between the two simulations are largest for column amounts of ozone precursors, particularly NO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span>. Across three high-ozone events, the YNT_SSNG simulation has a lower NO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> column bias (<span class="inline-formula">0.17×10<sup>15</sup></span> mol cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span>) compared to the AP-XM simulation (<span class="inline-formula">0.31×10<sup>15</sup></span> mol cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span>). The YNT_SSNG simulation also has an advantage in that it better captures the structure of the boundary layer and lake breeze during the 2 June high-ozone event, although the timing of the lake breeze is about 3 h too early at Sheboygan. Our results are useful for informing an air quality modeling framework for the Lake Michigan area.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:creator>Remsberg, Ellis</dc:creator>
      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>This study compares time series of stratospheric water vapor (SWV) data at 30 and 50 hPa from 1993 to 2005, based on sets of Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) profiles above the region of Boulder, CO (40<span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span> N, 255<span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span> E), and on local frost-point hygrometer (FPH) measurements. Their differing trends herein agree with most of the previously published findings. FPH trends are presumed to be accurate within their data uncertainties, and there are no known measurement biases affecting the HALOE trends. However, the seasonal sampling from HALOE is deficient at 40<span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span> N from 2001 to 2005, especially during late winter and springtime, when HALOE SWV time series at 55<span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span> N clearly show a springtime maximum. This study finds that the SWV trends from HALOE and FPH measurements nearly agree within uncertainties at 30 hPa for the more limited time span of 1993 to 2002. Yet, HALOE SWV at 50 hPa has significant and perhaps uncertain corrections for interfering aerosols from 1992 to 1994. Northern Hemisphere time series and daily SWV plots near 30 hPa from the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) experiment indicate that there is transport of filaments of high SWV from polar to middle latitudes during dynamically active winter and springtime periods. Although FPH measurements sense SWV variations at all scales, the HALOE time series do not resolve smaller-scale structures because its time series data are based on an average of four or more occultations within a finite latitude–longitude sector. It is concluded that the variations and trends of HALOE SWV are reasonable at 40<span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span> N and 30 hPa from 1993 to 2002 and in accord with the spatial scales of its measurements and sampling frequencies.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:title><![CDATA[Working at the limit: a review of thermodynamics and optimality of the Earth system]]></dc:title>
      <dc:creator>Kleidon, Axel</dc:creator>
      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Optimality concepts related to energy and entropy have long been proposed to govern Earth system processes, for instance in the form of propositions that certain processes maximize or minimize entropy production.  These concepts, however, remain quite obscure, seem contradictory to each other, and have so far been mostly disregarded.  This review aims to clarify the role of thermodynamics and optimality in Earth system science by showing that they play a central role in how, and how much, work can be derived from solar forcing and that this imposes a major constraint on the dynamics of dissipative structures of the Earth system.  This is, however, not as simple as it may sound.  It requires a consistent formulation of Earth system processes in thermodynamic terms, including their linkages and interactions.  Thermodynamics then constrains the ability of the Earth system to derive work and generate free energy from solar radiative forcing, which limits the ability to maintain motion, mass transport, geochemical cycling, and biotic activity.  It thus limits directly the generation of atmospheric motion and other processes indirectly through their need for transport.  I demonstrate the application of this thermodynamic Earth system view by deriving first-order estimates associated with atmospheric motion, hydrologic cycling, and terrestrial productivity that agree very well with observations.  This supports the notion that the emergent simplicity and predictability inherent in observed climatological variations can be attributed to these processes working as hard as they can, reflecting thermodynamic limits directly or indirectly.  I discuss how this thermodynamic interpretation is consistent with established theoretical concepts in the respective disciplines, interpret other optimality concepts in light of this thermodynamic Earth system view, and describe its utility for Earth system science.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>This paper provides a summary of the work done within Phase IV of the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration, Continued, with Correlation and unCertainty (OC6) project, under International Energy Agency Wind Technology Collaboration Programme Task 30. This phase focused on validating the loading on and motion of a novel floating offshore wind system. Numerical models of a 3.6-MW horizontal-axis wind turbine atop the TetraSpar floating support structure were compared using measurement data from a 1:43 Froude-scale test performed in the University of Maine&rsquo;s Alfond Wind-Wave (W2) Ocean Engineering Laboratory. Participants in the project ran a series of simulations, including system equilibrium, surge offsets, free-decays, wind-only conditions, wave-only conditions, and a combination of wind and wave conditions. Validation of the models was performed by comparing the aerodynamic loading, floating support structure motion, tower base loading, mooring line tensions, and keel line tensions. The results show a good estimation of the aerodynamic loading and a reasonable estimation of the platform motion and tower base fore-aft bending moment. However, there is a significant dispersion in the dynamic loading for the upwind mooring line. Very good agreement was observed between most of the numerical models and the experiment for the keel line tensions.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:creator>Stammler, Matthias</dc:creator>
      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Pitch bearings are critical for the safe and efficient operation of wind turbines. They connect the rotor blades to the rotor hub and allow for pitching movements that control loads and rotor speeds. While four-point contact ball bearings have been dominant in the past, three-row roller bearings are increasingly used in current designs due to their higher load capacity at the same diameter. Wear of the raceways is one of the possible damage mechanisms in pitch bearings. As roller bearings differ significantly from previous designs and because the operational conditions of wind turbines differ from other industrial applications, it is a reasonable de-risking exercise to undergo wear tests prior to the commissioning of such bearings. This study outlines a process for developing a wear test program based on aero-elastic simulation data and wind speed measurements. The process is then applied to an example roller bearing. The final program covers both standstill conditions and pitch cycles. The first is the main addition to former approaches. With existing test rigs and a reasonable budget and timeline, the program can be executed.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The rotor of a floating wind turbine is subject to complex aerodynamics due to changes in relative wind speeds at the blades and potential local interactions between blade sections and the rotor near-wake. These complex interactions are not yet fully understood. Lab-scale experiments are highly relevant for capturing these phenomena and provide means for the validation of numerical design tools. This paper presents a new wind tunnel experimental setup able to study the aerodynamic response of a wind turbine rotor when subjected to prescribed motions. The present study uses a 1:148 scale model of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine mounted on top of a 6 degrees of freedom parallel kinematics robotic platform. Firstly, the thrust variation of the turbine is investigated when single degrees of freedom harmonic motions are imposed by the platform, with surge, pitch and yaw being considered in this study. For reduced frequencies greater than 1.2, it is found that the thrust variation is amplified by up to 150 % compared to the quasi-steady value when the turbine is subject to pitch and surge motions, regardless of the amplitude of motion. A similar behaviour is also noticed under yaw motions. Secondly, realistic 6 degrees of freedom motions are imposed by the platform. The motions are derived from FAST simulations performed on the full-scale turbine coupled with the TripleSpar floater and the tests aim at exploring the thrust force dynamics for different sea states and wind conditions, obtaining reasonable agreement with the simulations. Finally, the work shows the capabilities and limitations of an off-the-shelf hexapod to perform hybrid testing of floating offshore wind turbines in wind tunnels.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Surface radiometer data from Ross Island, Antarctica, collected during the austral summer 2015&ndash;16 by the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE), are used to evaluate how shortwave and longwave irradiance respond to changing cloud properties as governed by contrasting meteorological regimes. Shortwave atmospheric transmittance is derived from pyranometer measurements, and cloud conservative-scattering optical depth is derived from filter radiometer measurements at 870 nm. With onshore flow associated with marine air masses, clouds contain mostly liquid water. With southerly flow over the Transantarctic Mountains, orographic forcing induces substantial cloud ice water content. These ice and mixed-phase clouds attenuate more surface shortwave irradiance than the maritime-influenced clouds, and also emit less longwave irradiance due to colder cloud base temperature. These detected irradiance changes are in a range that can mean onset or inhibition of surface melt over ice shelves. This study demonstrates how basic and relatively low-cost broadband and filter radiometers can be used to detect subtle climatological influences of contrasting cloud microphysical properties at very remote locations.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The structure and distribution of sub-glacial water directly influences Antarctic ice mass loss by reducing basal shear stress and enhancing grounding line retreat. A common technique for detecting sub-glacial water involves analyzing the spatial variation in reflectivity from an airborne ice penetrating radar (IPR) survey. Basic IPR analysis exploits the high dielectric contrast between water and most other substrate materials, where a reflectivity increase &ge; 15 <em>dB</em> is frequently correlated with the presence of sub-glacial water. There are surprisingly few additional tools to further characterize the size, shape, or extent of hydrological systems beneath large ice masses.</p> <p>We adapted an existing radar backscattering simulator to model IPR reflections from sub-glacial water structures using the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) Multifrequency Airborne Radar Sounder with Full-phase Assessment (MARFA) instrument. Our series of hypothetical simulations modeled water structures from 5 <em>m</em> to 50 <em>m</em> wide, surrounded by bed materials of varying roughness. We compared the relative reflectivity from rounded R&ouml;thlisberger channels and specular flat canals, showing both types of channels exhibit a positive correlation between size and reflectivity. Large (&gt; 20 <em>m</em>), flat canals can increase reflectivity by more than 20 <em>dB</em>, while equivalent R&ouml;thlisberger channels show only modest reflectivity gains of 8&minus;13 <em>dB</em>. Changes in substrate roughness may also alter observed reflectivity by 3&minus;6 <em>dB</em>. All of these results indicate that a sophisticated approach to IPR interpretation can be useful in constraining the size and shape of sub-glacial water, however a highly nuanced treatment of the geometric context is necessary.</p> <p>Finally, we compared simulated outputs to actual reflectivity from a single IPR flight line collected over Thwaites Glacier in 2022. The flight line crosses a previously proposed R&ouml;thlisberger channel route, with an obvious bright bed reflection in the radargram. Through multiple simulations, we demonstrated the important role that topography and water geometry can play in observed IPR reflectivity. We ultimately conclude the bright reflector from our IPR flight line is more likely a broad area of wide distributed water, such as a series of flat canals or sub-glacial lake, instead of a R&ouml;thlisberger channel. The approach outlined here has broad applicability for studying the basal environment of large glaciers, and can aid in constraining the geometry and extent of sub-glacial hydrologic structures.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>This study couples a high-resolution 1-D TKE ocean model (the SIT model) with the Community Atmosphere Model 5.3 (CAM5.3; hereafter CAM5&ndash;SIT) configuration, to highlight significant experiments that investigate the influence of different periods of sea surface temperature (SST) feedback, such as 30 minutes, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 30 days, on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). It substantially breaks through the limitations of flux coupler through air&ndash;sea coupling. The aim is to assess the scientific reproducibility and consistency of the findings across different SST feedback cycles in the field of modeling science. Comparing the results to the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5), the high-frequency experiments (C&ndash; CTL, C&ndash;1day, and C&ndash;3days) and low-frequency experiments (C&ndash;6days, C&ndash;12days, and C&ndash;18days) exhibit higher fidelity in capturing various aspects of MJO, except for the C&ndash;30days experiment. These aspects in characterizing the basic features of the MJO such as encompass intraseasonal periodicity, eastward propagation, coherence in the MJO band, tilting vertical structure, the lead&ndash;lag relationship between MJO- related atmosphere and SST variation, phase 2 column-integrated moisture static energy (MSE) tendency, and the projection of all MSE terms onto the MSE tendency of ERA5 across the Maritime Continent (MC). The MJO simulation performance of this study can be assessed in two ways. Firstly, the high-frequency experiments generally capture MJO characteristics, albeit with slightly lower results compared to ERA5 and NOAA data. Secondly, the low-frequency experiments show robust MJO simulations, which can be attributed to the accumulation of energy (temperature) in the upper ocean. This leads to the accumulation of shortwave and longwave radiations, as well as surface heat fluxes from the atmosphere.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The Goddard Profiling algorithm (GPROF) converts radiometer observations aboard Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation satellites to precipitation estimates. Analyzing the accuracy of GPROF&rsquo;s estimates is vital to further improve the algorithm. Such analyses often use high-quality ground-based estimates as reference with a different spatial resolution. Often, the reference is resampled to match the satellite&rsquo;s resolution. However, the implemented sampling method to simulate the satellite&rsquo;s resolution varies amongst studies, which limits the transferability of conclusions. additionally, GPROF combines observations from various sensors and frequency channels, each with its own footprint size. Hence, uncertainties related to sampling are added on top of the uncertainty introduced when converting brightness temperatures to precipitation intensities. The contribution of sampling to the total amount of uncertainty remains unknown.</p> <p>Here, we quantify the uncertainty related to sampling while analyzing the current performance of GPROF over the Netherlands during a four year period (2017&ndash;2020). In this area, shallow and light precipitation frequently occur. Both precipitation types are often subject to research, as both types are difficult to detect with space-borne sensors. Only GPROF estimates based on observations from the conical-scanning radiometers of the GPM constellation are used. We investigate the uncertainty related to sampling by simulating the reference precipitation as satellite footprints that vary in size, geometry, and applied weighting technique. The reference estimates are gauge-adjusted radar precipitation estimates from two ground-based weather radars from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). Echo top heights (ETH) retrieved from the same radars are used to classify the precipitation as shallow, medium, or deep.</p> <p>The method used to spatially average the reference into a satellite footprint, i.e. using Gaussian weighting or the arithmetic mean, is found to exhibit a minimal influence on the retrieved estimate. The size of the sampled area is found to be the most influential. Still, the effect of using different footprint sizes cannot explain all the differences between the ground- and satellite based precipitation estimates. Additionally, the discrepancies between GPROF and the reference are largest for low ETH, while the relative bias between the different footprint sizes and implemented weighting methods increase with increasing ETH. Lastly, our results do not show a clear difference between coastal simulations and simulations over land. We conclude that the uncertainty introduced by merging different channels and sensors cannot fully explain the errors introduced by the retrieval algorithm. Hence, retrieval errors are found to be more prominent than sampling uncertainties, in particular for shallow and light precipitation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Rainfall time series with high temporal resolution play a crucial role in various hydrological fields, such as urban hydrology, flood risk management, and soil erosion. Understanding the future changes in rainfall extreme values is essential for these applications. Since climate scenarios typically offer daily resolution only, statistical downscaling in time seems a promising and computational effective solution. The micro-canonical cascade model conserves the daily rainfall amounts exactly and with all model parameters expressed as physical interpretable probabilities avoids assumptions about future rainfall changes. Taking into account that rainfall extreme values are linked to high temperatures, the micro-canonical cascade model is further developed in this study. As the introduction of the temperature-dependency increases the number of cascade model parameters, several modifications for parameter reduction are tested beforehand. For this study 45 locations across Germany are selected. To ensure spatial coherence with the climate model data (~∆l=5 km*5 km), a composite product of radar and rain gauges with the same resolution was used for the estimation of the cascade model parameters. For the climate change analysis the core ensemble of the German Weather Service, which comprises six combinations of global and regional climate models is applied for both, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. For parameter reduction two approaches were analysed: i) the reduction via position-dependent probabilities and ii) parameter reduction via scale-independency. A combination of both approaches led to a reduction in the number of model parameters (48 parameters instead of 144 in the reference model) with only a minor worsening of the disaggregation results. The introduction of the temperature dependency improves the disaggregation results, particularly regarding rainfall extreme values and is therefore important to consider for future rainfall extreme value studies. For the disaggregated rainfall time series of climate scenarios, an increase of the rainfall extreme values is observed. Analyses of rainfall extreme values for different return periods for a rainfall duration of 5 min and 1 h indicate an increase of 5&ndash;10 % in the near-term future (2021&ndash;2050) and 15&ndash;25 % in the long-term future (2071&ndash;2100) compared to the control period (1971&ndash;2000).</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The unique geographical location of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role in regulating global climate change, but the impacts of the chemical components and atmospheric processing on the size distribution and mixing state of individual particles are rarely explored in the south-eastern margin of the TP, which is a transport channel for pollutants from Southeast Asia to the TP during the pre-monsoon season. Thus a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) was deployed to investigate how the local emissions of chemical composition interact with the transporting particles and assess the mixing state of different particle types and secondary formation in this study. The TP particles were classified into six distinct types, mainly including the largest fraction of the potassium-rich (K-rich) type in the total particles (30.9 %), followed by the biomass burning (BB) type (18.7 %). Most particle types were mainly transported from the sampling site's surroundings and along the Sino-Myanmar border, but the air mass trajectories from north-eastern India and Myanmar show a greater impact on the number fraction of the BB (31.7 %) and dust (18.2 %) types, respectively. Then, the two episodes with high particle concentrations showed that the differences in the meteorological conditions in the same trajectory clusters could cause significant changes in chemical components, especially the dust and aged elemental carbon (aged EC) types, which changed by a total of 93.6 % and 72.0 %, respectively. Ammonium and dust particles distribute at a relatively larger size (<span class="inline-formula">∼600</span> nm), but the size peak of other types is present at <span class="inline-formula">∼440</span> nm.

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The application of machine learning (ML) including deep learning models in hydrogeology to model and predict groundwater level in monitoring wells has gained some traction in recent years. By now, the dominant model class is so called single-well models, where one model is trained for each well separately. However, recent developments in neighbouring disciplines including hydrology (rainfall-runoff-modelling) have shown that global models, being able to incorporate data of several wells, may have advantages. These models are often called entity-aware models, as they usually rely on static data to differentiate the entities, i.e. groundwater wells in hydrogeology or catchments in surface hydrology. We test two kinds of static information to characterize the groundwater wells in a global, entity-aware deep learning model setup, first, environmental features that are continuously available and thus theoretically allow spatial generalization (regionalization), and second, timeseries features that are derived from the past time series at the respective well. Moreover, we test random integer features as entity information for comparison. We use a published dataset of 108 groundwater wells in Germany, and evaluate the models&rsquo; performances in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) in an in-sample and an out-of-sample setting, representing temporal and spatial generalization. Our results show, that entity-aware models work well with a mean performance of NSE &gt; 0.8 in an in-sample setting, thus being comparable to, or even outperforming single-well models. However, they do not generalize well spatially in an out-of-sample setting (mean NSE &lt; 0.7, i.e. lower than a global model without entity information). The reason for this potentially lies in the small number of wells in the dataset, which might not be enough to take full advantage of global models. However, also more research is needed to find meaningful static features for ML in hydrogeology.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Hydrological models are widely used to research hydrological change and risk. Yet, the power embedded in the modelling process and outcomes are often concealed by claiming its neutrality. Our systematic review shows that in scientific literature relatively little attention is given to the power of models to influence development processes and outcomes in water governance. The review also shows that there is much to learn from those who are willing to be openly reflexive on the influence of models. In agreement with this emerging body of work, we call for power-sensitive modelling, which means that people are critical about how models are made and with what implications, taking into account that: i) The choice for and use of models for water management happens in a political context and has political consequences; ii) Models are the result of choices made by modellers and &ndash; since they have political consequences &ndash; these need to be made as explicit as possible as opposed to being &ldquo;blackboxed&rdquo;; iii) To consider the ethical implications of the choices of modellers, commissioners, and users, and to improve accountability, models and their power need to be understood by connecting the inner workings of a model with a contextual understanding of its development and use, iv) Action is taken upon these implications by democratising modelling processes. Our call should not be understood as a suggestion to do away with modelling altogether, but rather as an invitation to interrogate how quantitative models may help to foster transformative pathways towards more just and equitable water distributions.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Operational forecasting systems routinely assimilate daily means of sea ice concentration (SIC) from microwave radiometers in order to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. However, the temporal and spatial averaging of the satellite individual swaths into daily means of SIC entails two main drawbacks: (i) the spatial resolution of the original product is blurred (specially critical on periods with strong sub-daily sea ice movement), and (ii) the sub-daily frequency of passive microwave observations in the Arctic is not used, providing less temporal resolution in the data assimilation (DA) analysis and therefore, in the forecast. Within the SIRANO (Sea Ice Retrievals and data Assimilation in NOrway) project, we investigate how challenge (i) and (ii) can be avoided by assimilating satellite individual swaths (Level-3 Uncollated) instead of daily means (Level-3) of SIC. To do so, we use a regional configuration of the Barents Sea (2.5 km grid) based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and The Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) together with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) as the DA system. The assimilation of individual swaths significantly improves the EnKF analysis of SIC compared to the assimilation of daily means; the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) shows a 10 % improvement at the end of the assimilation period, and a 7 % improvement at the end of the 7-day forecast period. This improvement is caused by better exploitation of the information provided by the SIC swath data, in terms of both spatial and temporal variance, compared to the case when the swaths are combined to form a daily mean before assimilation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxide (NO) in the stratosphere are relevant to understand long-term changes and variabilities in stratospheric nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations. Due to the versatile role of NO<sub>2</sub> and NO in stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry they are important for recovery and build-up of O<sub>3</sub> holes in the stratosphere, and therefore can indirectly affect the human life. Thus, we present in this work the evaluation of NO<sub>2</sub> and NO stratospheric partial columns (&gt; 16 km altitude) retrieved from ground-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements from over 25 years at Zugspitze (47.42&deg; N, 10.98&deg; E, 2964 m a.s.l.) and 18 years at Garmisch (47.47&deg; N, 11.06&deg; E, 745 m a.s.l.), Germany. The obtained stratospheric columns are only weakly influenced by tropospheric pollution and show only a very small bias of (2.5&plusmn;0.2) % when comparing NO<sub>2</sub> above Zugspitze and Garmisch. Stratospheric columns of both NO<sub>2</sub> and NO show a diurnal increase in dependence of local solar time (LST). We quantified this behavior by calculating diurnal increasing rates. Here, we find mean values for the NO<sub>2</sub> diurnal increasing rate of (0.89&plusmn;0.14)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and (0.94&plusmn;0.14)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> at Zugspitze and Garmisch, respectively. The mean NO a.m. diurnal increasing rate above Zugspitze can be found to be (1.42&plusmn;0.12)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Regarding the seasonal dependency of these increasing rates, for the first time, we were able to detect a significant seasonal variation of both NO<sub>2</sub> diurnal increasing rates and NO a.m. diurnal increasing rates experimentally with a maximum of (1.13&plusmn;0.04)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for NO<sub>2</sub> and (1.76&plusmn;0.25)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for NO in September and a minimum of (0.71&plusmn;0.18)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> in December for NO<sub>2</sub> and a minimum of (1.18&plusmn;0.41)&middot;10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> in November for NO. This similar behavior may be explained by the interconnection of both species in stratospheric photochemistry. The outcome of this work is a retrieval and analyzation strategy of FTIR data for NO<sub>x</sub> stratospheric columns, which can help to further validate photochemical models or improve satellite validations. The first use of this data set is shown in a companion paper (N&uuml;rnberg et al., 2023) extracting experiment-based NO<sub>x</sub> scaling factors describing the diurnal increase out of the retrieved partial columns and validating recently published model-based scaling factors.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Black carbon (BC) is a crucial component of aerosols in the atmosphere. Understanding the hygroscopicity of BC particles is important for studying their role as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN), as well as their chemical behavior and atmospheric lifetime. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the factors that determine the hygroscopic properties of fresh BC. In this work, the hygroscopic behavior of BC particles generated from different types of fuel and aged with SO<sub>2</sub> for varying durations were measured by a vapor sorption analyzer while various characterizations of BC were conducted to understand the key factors that influence the hygroscopic properties of BC. It was found that the presence of water-soluble substances in BC facilitates the completion of monolayer water adsorption at low relative humidity, while also increasing the number of water adsorption layers at high relative humidity. On the other hand, BC prepared by burning organic fuels, which typically lacks water-soluble inorganic ions, primarily exhibits hygroscopicity characteristics influenced by organic carbon (OC) and microstructure. Furthermore, the hygroscopicity of BC can be enhanced by the formation of sulfate ions due to heterogeneous oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub>. This finding sheds light on the critical factors that affect BC hygroscopicity during water adsorption and allows for estimating the interaction between water molecules and BC particles in a humid atmosphere.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol, a significant component of atmospheric fine particles, which can affect air quality, human health, and climate change. However, current understanding of the formation mechanism of SOA is still incomplete, which is not only due to the complexity of the chemistry, but also relates to analytical challenges in SOA precursor detection and quantification. Recent instrumental advances, especially the developments of high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS), greatly enhanced the capability to detect low- and extremely low-volatility organic molecules (L/ELVOCs). Although detection and characterization of low volatility vapors largely improved our understanding of SOA formation, analyzing and interpreting complex mass spectrometric data remains a challenging task. This necessitates the use of dimension-reduction techniques to simplify mass spectrometric data with the purpose of extracting chemical and kinetic information of the investigated system. Here we present an approach by using fuzzy <em>c</em>-means clustering (FCM) to analyze CIMS data from chamber experiments aiming to investigate the gas-phase chemistry of nitrate radical initiated oxidation of isoprene.</p> <p>The performance of FCM was evaluated and validated. By applying FCM various oxidation products were classified into different groups according to their chemical and kinetic properties, and the common patterns of their time series were identified, which gave insights into the chemistry of the system investigated. The chemical properties are characterized by elemental ratios and average carbon oxidation state, and the kinetic behaviors are parameterized with generation number and effective rate coefficient (describing the average reactivity of a species) by using the gamma kinetic parameterization model. In addition, the fuzziness of FCM algorithm provides a possibility to separate isomers or different chemical processes species are involved in, which could be useful for mechanism development. Overall FCM is a well applicable technique to simplify complex mass spectrometric data, and the chemical and kinetic properties derived from clustering can be utilized to understand the reaction system of interest.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Heat extremes and associated impacts are considered the most pressing issue for German regional governments with respect to climate adaptation. We explore the potential of a unique high-resolution, convection-permitting (2.8 m), multi-GCM (global climate model) ensemble with COSMO-CLM (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling Climate Limited-area Modelling) regional simulations (1971–2100) over Germany regarding heat extremes and related impacts. We find a systematically reduced cold bias especially in summer in the convection-permitting simulations compared to the driving simulations with a grid size of 7 km and parametrized convection. The projected increase in temperature and its variance favors the development of longer and hotter heat waves, especially in late summer and early autumn. In a 2 <span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span>C (3 <span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span>C) warmer world, a 26 % (100 %) increase in the heat wave magnitude index is anticipated. Human heat stress (universal thermal climate index (UTCI) <span class="inline-formula">&gt;</span> 32 <span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span>C) and region-specific parameters tailored to climate adaptation revealed a dependency on the major landscapes, resulting in significantly higher heat exposure in flat regions such as the Rhine Valley, accompanied by the strongest absolute increase. A nonlinear, exponential increase is anticipated for parameters characterizing strong heat stress (UTCI <span class="inline-formula">&gt;</span> 32 <span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span>C, tropical nights, very hot days). Providing region-specific and tailored climate information, we demonstrate the potential of convection-permitting simulations to facilitate improved impact studies and narrow the gap between climate modeling and stakeholder requirements for climate adaptation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Reliable statistics on anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are fundamental for carbon cycle and climate change research. Satellite observations offer a potential objective and efficient alternative to the current self-reporting mechanism. However, the current satellite projects provide only column-averaged CO<sub>2</sub> amount (XCO<sub>2</sub>) data. This paper proposes a direct estimation method based on satellite-based CO<sub>2</sub> column amount, different from the conventional &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approaches, which usually adopt satellite-observed data as an indicator to disaggregate consumption statistics. Here, the monthly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 2010 to 2019 are estimated globally using CO<sub>2</sub> data retrieved from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. The geographically and temporally weighted regression model is adopted to account for local spatial and temporal variability. The enhanced XCO<sub>2</sub> data and the local wind speed, vertical velocity, air temperature, water vapor concentration, and fire emissions are included in the estimation process. The validation results of the newly derived CO<sub>2</sub> emissions strongly agree with the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.929). This high global consistency demonstrates the great potential of direct estimation from satellites, with improved frequency and a broader coverage range.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Monitoring the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> and methane CH<sub>4</sub> is a key ingredient for fostering our understanding of the mechanisms behind the sources and sinks of these gases and for verifying and quantitatively attributing their anthropogenic emissions. Here, we present the instrumental setup and performance evaluation of an open-path GHG observatory in the city of Heidelberg, Germany. The observatory measures path-averaged concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> along a 1.55 km path in the urban boundary layer above the city. We are combining these open-path data with local in-situ measurements to evaluate the representativeness of these observation types on the kilometer-scale. This representativeness is necessary to accurately quantify emissions, since atmospheric models tasked with this job typically operate on kilometer-scale horizontal grids.</p> <p>For the operational period between Feb. 8 and Jul. 11, 2023, we find a precision of 2.7 ppm (0.58 %) and 18 ppb (0.89 %) for the dry air mole fractions of CO<sub>2</sub> (xCO<sub>2</sub>) and CH<sub>4</sub> (xCH<sub>4</sub>) in 5-minute measurements, respectively. After calibration, the open-path measurements show excellent agreement with the local in-situ data under atmospheric background conditions. Both datasets show clear signals of traffic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the diurnal CO<sub>2</sub> cycle. However, there are particular situations, such as under south-easterly wind conditions, where the in-situ and open-path data reveal distinct differences up to 20 ppm in xCO<sub>2</sub> most likely related to their different sensitivity to local emission and transport patterns.</p> <p>Our setup is based on a Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer, which offers a spacious and modular design providing ample opportunities for future refinements of the technique with respect to finer spectral resolution and wider spectral coverage to inform on gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The cycling of carbon in the oceans is affected by feedbacks driven by changes in climate and atmospheric <span class="inline-formula">CO<sub>2</sub></span>. Understanding these feedbacks is therefore an important prerequisite for projecting future climate. Marine biogeochemistry models are a useful tool but, as with any model, are a simplification and need to be continually improved. In this study, we coupled the Finite-volumE Sea ice–Ocean Model (FESOM2.1) to the Regulated Ecosystem Model version 3 (REcoM3). FESOM2.1 is an update of the Finite-Element Sea ice–Ocean Model (FESOM1.4) and operates on unstructured meshes. Unlike standard structured-mesh ocean models, the mesh flexibility allows for a realistic representation of small-scale dynamics in key regions at an affordable computational cost. Compared to the previous coupled model version of FESOM1.4–REcoM2, the model FESOM2.1–REcoM3 utilizes a new dynamical core, based on a finite-volume discretization instead of finite elements, and retains central parts of the biogeochemistry model. As a new feature, carbonate chemistry, including water vapour correction, is computed by mocsy 2.0. Moreover, REcoM3 has an extended food web that includes macrozooplankton and fast-sinking detritus. Dissolved oxygen is also added as a new tracer. In this study, we assess the ocean and biogeochemical state simulated with FESOM2.1–REcoM3 in a global set-up at relatively low spatial resolution forced with JRA55-do <span class="cit" id="xref_paren.1">(<a href="#bib1.bibx205">Tsujino et al.</a>, <a href="#bib1.bibx205">2018</a>)</span> atmospheric reanalysis. The focus is on the recent period (1958–2021) to assess how well the model can be used for present-day and future climate change scenarios on decadal to centennial timescales. A bias in the global ocean–atmosphere preindustrial <span class="inline-formula">CO<sub>2</sub></span> flux present in the previous model version (FESOM1.4–REcoM2) could be significantly reduced. In addition, the computational efficiency is 2–3 times higher than that of FESOM1.4–REcoM2. Overall, it is found that FESOM2.1–REcoM3 is a skilful tool for ocean biogeochemical modelling applications.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Consistent estimates of avalanche size are crucial for communicating not only among avalanche practitioners but also between avalanche forecasters and the public, for instance in public avalanche forecasts. Moreover, applications such as risk management and numerical avalanche simulations rely on accurately mapped outlines of past avalanche events. Since there is not a widely applicable and objective way to measure avalanche size or to determine the outlines of an avalanche, we need to rely on human estimations. Therefore, knowing about the reliability of avalanche size estimates and avalanche outlines is essential as errors will impact applications relying on this kind of data. In the first of three user studies, we investigate the reliability in avalanche size estimates by comparing estimates for 10 avalanches made by 170 avalanche professionals working in Europe or North America. In the other two studies, both completed as pilot studies, we explore reliability in the mappings of six avalanches from oblique photographs from 10 participants and the mappings of avalanches visible on 2.9 km<span class="inline-formula"><sup>2</sup></span> of remotely sensed imagery in four different spatial resolutions from 5 participants. We observed an average agreement of 66 % in the most frequently given avalanche size, while agreement with the avalanche size considered “correct” was 74 %. Moreover, European avalanche practitioners rated avalanches significantly larger for 8 out of 10 avalanches, compared to North Americans. Assuming that participants are equally competent in the estimation of avalanche size, we calculated a score describing the factor required to obtain the observed agreement rate between any two size estimates. This factor was 0.72 in our dataset. It can be regarded as the certainty related to a size estimate by an individual and thus provides an indication of the reliability of a label. For the outlines mapped from oblique photographs, we noted a mean overlapping proportion of 52 % for any two avalanche mappings and 60 % compared to a reference mapping. The outlines mapped from remotely sensed imagery had a mean overlapping proportion of 46 % (image resolution of 2 m) to 68 % (25 <span class="inline-formula">cm</span>) between any two mappings and 64 % (2 m) to 80 % (25 <span class="inline-formula">cm</span>) when compared to the reference. The presented findings demonstrate that the reliability of size estimates and of mapped avalanche outlines is limited. As these data are often used as reference data or even ground truth to validate further applications, the identified limitations and uncertainties may influence results and should be considered.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>A fully probabilistic earthquake risk model was developed for five countries in Central Asia, providing updated earthquake loss estimates with a higher level of details on all components with respect to previous studies in the region, besides having used a regionally consistent approach that on the one hand, allows direct comparisons at different disaggregation levels (e.g., Country and Oblast), and on the other hand, is aimed to facilitate initiating a policy dialogue regarding national and regional disaster risk financing and insurance applications. This earthquake risk model made use of a regional probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, as well as a comprehensive exposure database on which different types of assets and sectors were included, and for which two scenarios (years 2020 and 2080) were modelled. For each type of asset, a unique vulnerability function was derived and later used for the convolution with the hazard data that allowed estimating the loss exceedance curve, at different disaggregation levels, from where other risk metrics such as the average annual loss (AAL) and specific return period losses, were obtained. The regional earthquake AAL for the 2020 exposure scenario has been estimated in around $2 Bn, being Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan the countries with the highest earthquake risk levels in the region. Besides the probabilistic earthquake risk results, as-if scenarios were modelled using a pseudo-deterministic approach to assess the human and economic losses for realistic and representative earthquakes for the main cities within earthquake prone regions in the five countries within the study area.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>In the context of climate change, height and frequency variations of extreme sea levels (ESL) are studied using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. However, this type of approach does not highlight the dynamic effects (waves, currents) generated by meteocean events, beyond their effects on sea-levels. In particular, ESL estimates are certainly calculated by considering the main determining physical factors but cannot report on all the effects of these factors. Ultimately, this can lead to confusion between ESL and hazard. This article proposes a systemic assessment method to analyze coastal hazard changes at regional scales, integrating parameters influencing sea-levels, as well as factors describing the geomorphological context (length and shape of the coast, width of the continental shelf), meteocean events (storms, cyclones and tsunamis), and the marine environment (e.g., coral reef state and sea ice extent). French mainland and overseas territories were selected to apply the method. We have thus highlighted the need to study not only the sea-level variability, but also the current and future characteristics of meteocean events. The long, concave coasts bordered by a wide continental shelf appear particularly sensitive to variations in the intensity or trajectory of meteocean events. Coral reef degradation in the tropics and the decrease in seasonal sea ice extent in the polar regions can also significantly change the nearshore hydrodynamics and impacts on the shoreline. These results help to predict the types of hazard (shoreline erosion, rapid submersion and/or permanent flooding) that will increase the most in different coastal zones.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Streamflow variability plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems, which can be simulated and projected by river routing model coupled with land surface model. However, the simulation of streamflow at large scales is subject to considerable uncertainties, primarily arising from two related processes: runoff generation (hydrological process) and river routing (hydraulic process). While both processes have impacts on streamflow variability, previous studies only calibrated one of the two processes to reduce biases in the simulated streamflow. Calibration focusing only on one process can result in unrealistic parameter values to compensate for the bias resulted from the other process, thus other water related variables remain poorly simulated. In this study, we performed several experiments with the land and river components of Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) over the Pantanal region to disentangle the hydrological and hydraulic controls on streamflow variability in coupled land-river simulation. Our results show that the generation of subsurface runoff is the most important factor for streamflow variability contributed by runoff generation process, while floodplain storage effect and main channel roughness have significant impacts on streamflow variability through the river routing process. We further propose a two-step procedure to robustly calibrate the two processes together. The impacts of runoff generation and river routing on streamflow are appropriately addressed with the two-step calibration, which may be adopted by Land Surface Model and Earth System Model developers to improve modelling of streamflow.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Cloud radiative heating (CRH) within the atmosphere affects the dynamics and predictability of extratropical cyclones. However, CRH is uncertain in numerical weather prediction and climate models, and this could affect model predictions of extratropical cyclones. In this paper, we present a systematic quantification of CRH uncertainties. To this end, we study an idealized extratropical cyclone simulated at a convection-permitting resolution of 2.5 km, and combine large-eddy simulations at 300 m resolution with offline radiative transfer calculations. We quantify four factors contributing to the CRH uncertainty in different regions of the cyclone: 3D cloud radiative effects, parameterization of ice-optical properties, cloud horizontal heterogeneity, and cloud vertical overlap. The two last factors can be considered to be essentially resolved at 300 m but need to be parametrized at 2.5 km resolution. Our results indicate that the parameterization of ice-optical properties and the cloud horizontal heterogeneity are the two factors contributing most to the uncertainty in CRH. On the other hand, 3D cloud radiative effects are much smaller, especially for stratiform clouds within the warm conveyor belt of the cyclone. Our analysis in particular highlights the potential to improve the simulation of CRH by better representing ice-optical properties. Future work should in particular address how uncertainty in ice-optical properties affects the dynamics and predictability of extratropical cyclones.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Effective monitoring of global water resources is increasingly critical due to climate change and population growth. Advancements in remote sensing technology, especially in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, have revolutionized water resource monitoring, leading to more frequent and high-quality surface water extent maps using various techniques such as traditional image processing and machine learning algorithms. However, satellite imagery datasets contain trade-offs that result in inconsistencies in performance. For example, the disparity in measurement principles between optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors, and differences in spatial and spectral resolutions among optical sensors. Therefore, developing accurate and robust surface water mapping solutions requires independent validations from multiple datasets in order to identify potential biases within imagery and algorithms. However, high-quality validation datasets are expensive to build, and few contain information on water resources. For this purpose, we introduce a globally sampled, high spatial resolution dataset labeled using 3m PlanetScope imagery. Our surface water extent dataset comprises of 90 images, each with a size of 1024x1024 pixels, which were sampled using a stratified random sampling strategy. We covered all 14 biomes and also highlighted urban and rural regions, lakes, and rivers, including braided rivers and shorelines. To demonstrate the usability of our dataset, we evaluated our novel Sentinel-1 algorithm called the Equal Percent Solution (EPS) for surface water extent delineation. Our method produced an overall accuracy of 88 %, with low commission error. However, EPS also had a high omission error. While investigating the source behind this issue using our hand labels, we found evidence that water signals in Sentinel-1 are affected by turbulence and muddiness. Further, mountainous regions distorted the signals from the water in river valleys leading to inaccuracies. Similar to our evaluation, we expect our dataset to be used for analyzing satellite products and methods to gain insights into their advantages and drawbacks. We expect our high-quality dataset to improve our understanding of the accuracy, spatial generalizability, and robustness of existing surface water products and methods to promote efficient monitoring of our natural resources.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Between April 2002 and June 2017, the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) made continuous measurements of a suite of in situ aerosol optical properties at a long-term monitoring site near Trinidad Head (THD), California. In addition to aerosol optical properties, between 2002–2006 a scanning humidograph system was operated, and inorganic ion and total aerosol mass concentrations were obtained from filter measurements. A combined analysis of these datasets demonstrates consistent patterns in aerosol climatology and highlights changes in sources throughout the year. THD is predictably dominated by sea salt aerosols; however, marine biogenic aerosols are the largest contributor to PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>1</sub></span> in the warmer months. Additionally, a persistent combustion source appears in the winter, likely a result of wintertime home heating. While the influences of local anthropogenic sources from vehicular and marine traffic are visible in the optical aerosol data, their influence is largely dictated by the wind direction at the site. Comparison of the THD aerosol climatology to that reported for other marine sites shows that the location is representative of clean marine measurements, even with the periodic influence of anthropogenic sources.</p>]]></dc:description>

Upon cycling the relative humidity (RH) between 3 % and 80 % RH, ammonium nitrate (AN) and GC mixed particles did not exhibit any phase change, whereas sodium nitrate (SN) and GC mixed particles crystallized at 60 % and deliquesced at 82 % RH.

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>A global aerosol–climate model is applied to quantify the impact of the transport sectors (land transport, shipping, and aviation) on aerosol and climate. Global simulations are performed for the present day (2015), based on the emission inventory of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), and for near-term (2030) and mid-term (2050) future projections, under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The results for the present day show that land transport emissions have a large impact on near-surface concentrations of black carbon and aerosol nitrate over the most populated areas of the globe, but with contrasting patterns in terms of relative contributions between developed and developing countries. In spite of the recently introduced regulations to limit the fuel sulfur content in the shipping sector, shipping emissions are still responsible for a considerable impact on aerosol sulfate near-surface concentrations, about 0.5 to 1 <span class="inline-formula">µ</span>g m<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−3</sup></span> in the most travelled regions, with significant effects on continental air pollution and in the northern polar regions as well. Aviation impacts on aerosol mass are found to be quite small, of the order of a few nanograms per cubic metre, while this sector considerably affects particle number concentrations, contributing up to 20 %–30 % of the upper-tropospheric particle number concentration at the northern mid-latitudes. The transport-induced impacts on aerosol mass and number concentrations result in a present-day radiative forcing of <span class="inline-formula">−164</span>, <span class="inline-formula">−145</span>, and <span class="inline-formula">−64</span> mW m<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span> for land transport, shipping, and aviation, respectively, with a dominating contribution by aerosol–cloud interactions. These forcings represent a marked offset to the CO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> warming from the transport sectors and are therefore very relevant for climate policy. The projections under the SSPs show that the impact of the transport sectors on aerosol and climate are generally consistent with the narratives underlying these scenarios: the lowest impacts of transport on both aerosol and climate are simulated under SSP1, especially for the land transport sector, while SSP3 is generally characterized by the largest effects. Notable exceptions to this picture, however, exist, as the emissions of other anthropogenic sectors also contribute to the overall aerosol concentrations and thus modulate the relevance of the transport sectors in the different scenarios, not always consistently with their underlying storyline. On a qualitative level, the results for the present day mostly confirm the findings of our previous assessment for the year 2000, which used a predecessor version of the same model and the CMIP5 emission data. Some important quantitative differences are found, which can mostly be ascribed to the improved representation of aerosol background concentrations in the present study.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Earthworm invasion in North American forests has the potential to greatly impact soil microbial communities by altering soil physicochemical properties, including structure, pH, nutrient availability, and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. While most research on the topic has been carried out in northern temperate forests, little is known about the impact of invasive earthworms on soil microbial communities in hemiboreal and boreal forests, characterized by a slower decay of organic matter (OM). Earthworm activities can increase OM mineralization, altering nutrient cycling and biological activity in a biome where low carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability typically limits microbial and plant growth. Here, we characterized and compared microbial communities of earthworm-invaded and non-invaded soils in previously described sites across three major soil types found in the Canadian (hemi)boreal forest using a space-for-time approach. Microbial communities of forest floors and surface mineral soils were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and archaea and of the internal-transcriber-spacer-2 (ITS2) region for fungi. In forest floors, the effects of earthworm invasion were minor. In mineral soil horizons, earthworm invasion was associated with higher fungal biomass and greater relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Oligotrophic bacteria (Acidobacteriota and Chloroflexi) were less abundant in invaded mineral soils, where Gram(<span class="inline-formula">+</span>) : Gram(<span class="inline-formula">−</span>) ratios were also lower, while the opposite was observed for the copiotrophic Bacteroidota. Additionally, earthworm-invaded mineral soils harboured higher fungal and bacterial species diversity and richness. Considering the important role of soil microbial communities for ecosystem functioning, such earthworm-induced shifts in their community composition are likely to impact nutrient cycling, as well as vegetation development and forest productivity at a large scale, as the invasion progresses in these (hemi)boreal systems.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>We apply a local ensemble transform Kalman smoother (LETKS) in combination with the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM–HAM to estimate aerosol emissions from POLDER-3/PARASOL (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) observations for the year 2006. We assimilate aerosol optical depth at 550 <span class="inline-formula">mnm</span> (<span class="inline-formula">AOD<sub>550</sub></span>), the Ångström exponent at 550 and 865 <span class="inline-formula">nm</span> (<span class="inline-formula">AE<sub>550–865</sub></span>), and single-scattering albedo at 550 <span class="inline-formula">nm</span> (<span class="inline-formula">SSA<sub>550</sub></span>) in order to improve modeled aerosol mass, size and absorption simultaneously. The new global aerosol emissions increase to 1419 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>28 %) for dust, 1850 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>75 %) for sea salt, 215 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>143 %) for organic aerosol and 13.3 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>75 %) for black carbon, while the sulfur dioxide emissions increase to 198 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>42 %) and the total deposition of sulfates to 293 <span class="inline-formula">Tg yr<sup>−1</sup></span> (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>39 %). Organic and black carbon emissions are much higher than their prior values from bottom-up inventories, with a stronger increase in biomass burning sources (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>193 % and <span class="inline-formula">+</span>90 %) than in anthropogenic sources (115 % and 70 %). The evaluation of the experiments with POLDER (assimilated) and AERONET as well as MODIS Dark Target (independent) observations shows a clear improvement compared with the ECHAM–HAM control run. Specifically  based on AERONET, the global mean error in <span class="inline-formula">AOD<sub>550</sub></span> improves from <span class="inline-formula">−</span>0.094 to <span class="inline-formula">−</span>0.006, while absorption aerosol optical depth at 550 <span class="inline-formula">nm</span> (<span class="inline-formula">AAOD<sub>550</sub></span>) improves from <span class="inline-formula">−</span>0.009 to <span class="inline-formula">−</span>0.004 after the assimilation. A smaller improvement is also observed  in the <span class="inline-formula">AE<sub>550–865</sub></span> mean absolute error (from 0.428 to 0.393), with a considerably higher improvement over isolated island sites at the ocean. The new dust emissions are closer to the ensemble median of AEROCOM I, AEROCOM III and CMIP5 as well as some of the previous assimilation studies. The new sea salt emissions have become closer to the reported emissions from previous studies. Indications of a missing fraction of coarse dust and sea salt particles are discussed. The biomass burning changes (based on POLDER) can be used as alternative biomass burning scaling factors for the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) inventory distinctively estimated for organic carbon (2.93) and black carbon (1.90) instead of the recommended scaling of 3.4 (Kaiser et al., 2012). The estimated emissions are highly sensitive to the relative humidity due to aerosol water uptake, especially in the case of  sulfates. We found that ECHAM–HAM, like most of the global climate models (GCMs) that participated in AEROCOM and CMIP6, overestimated the relative humidity compared with ERA5 and as a result the water uptake by aerosols, assuming the kappa values are not underestimated. If we use the ERA5 relative humidity, sulfate emissions must be further increased, as modeled sulfate AOD is lowered. Specifically, over East Asia, the lower AOD can be attributed to the underestimated precipitation and the lack of simulated nitrates in the model.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Basin inversion is commonly attributed to the reverse reactivation of basin-bounding normal faults. This association implies that basin uplift and inversion-related structures are mainly controlled by the frictional behaviour of pre-existing faults and associated damage zones. In this study, we use lithospheric-scale analogue experiments of orthogonal extension followed by shortening to explore how the flow behaviour of ductile layers underneath rift basins promote or suppress basin inversion. Our experiments show that the rheology of the ductile lower crust and lithospheric mantle, modulated by the imposed bulk strain rate, determine (1) basin distribution in a wide rift setting and (2) strain accommodation by fault reactivation and basin uplift during subsequent shortening. When the ductile layers deform uniformly during extension (i.e. stretching) and shortening (i.e. thickening), all of the basins are inverted. When deformation in the ductile layers is localised during extension (i.e. necking) and shortening (i.e. folding), only some basins – which are evenly spaced apart – are inverted. We interpret the latter as selective basin inversion, which may be related to the superposition of crustal-scale and lithospheric-scale boudinage during the previous basin-forming extensional phase and/or folding of the ductile layers during shortening.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Extensive continuous particle number size distribution measurements took place during two summers (2020 and 2021) in 11 sites in Greece for the investigation of the frequency and the spatial extent of new particle formation (NPF). The study area is characterized by high solar intensity, fast photochemistry, and has moderate to low fine particulate matter levels during the summer. The average PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were relatively uniform across the examined sites. The NPF frequency during summer varied from close to zero in the southwestern parts of Greece to more than 60 % in the northern, central, and eastern regions. The mean particle growth rate for each station varied between 3.4 and 8 nm h<sup>-1</sup>, with an average rate of 5.7 nm h<sup>-1</sup>. In most of the sites there was no statistical difference in the condensation sink between NPF event and non-event days, while lower relative humidity was observed during the events. The high NPF frequency sites in the north and northeast were in close proximity to both coal-fired power plants (high emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>) and to agricultural areas with some of the highest ammonia emissions in the country. The southern and western parts of Greece, where NPF was infrequent, were characterized by low ammonia emissions, while moderate levels of sulfuric acid were estimated (10<sup>7</sup> molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>) in the west. Although the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds were higher in western and southern sectors, they did not appear to lead to enhanced frequency of NPF. The infrequent events in these sites occurred when the air masses had spent a few hours over areas with agricultural activities, and thus elevated ammonia emissions. Air masses arriving at the sites directly from the sea were not connected with atmospheric nucleation. These results support the hypothesis that ammonia and/or amines are limiting new particle formation in the study area.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:creator>Winkler, Peter</dc:creator>
      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The Societas Meteorologica Palatina arranged the first international meteorological network in a modern sense, being in operation between 1781 and 1792 during the last period of enlightenment. A total of 39 stations contributed observations. The original aim was to investigate influences of the moon and planets on the atmosphere. Instruments were provided free of charge; a physically very advanced instruction guaranteed reliable observational results, and the data collected at 3 different hours per day were printed at high cost in the <i>Ephemerides Societatis Meteorologicae Palatinae</i> (denoted <i>Ephemerides</i> hereafter) of Mannheim. This wealth of data has become a famous treasure trove for scientists and has been used later very often for climatic studies, for climatic comparisons of different locations in textbooks, for overcoming wrong but generally accepted or even outdated (e.g. scholastic) views; for finding new explanations for meteorological phenomena, and for studying extremes of meteorological parameters. Even in modern times, the data were evaluated and used to reconstruct historical weather maps. Although, meanwhile, some problems of the historical instruments have been recognized, most of the conclusions are still basically correct. The data were also used for verifying geomagnetic models or proxy data from tree-ring analysis. This network stimulated many scholars for special meteorological studies, and it was attractive for new stations to join the network. The early death of the meteorological secretary Johann Jakob Hemmer and the Napoleonic Wars brought about the end of the project. Nevertheless, many of the stations continued the observations using the available instruments.</p>]]></dc:description>

A total of 15.27 GW is converted from the barotropic to the baroclinic M2 tide with the main conversion sites associated with the most prominent bathymetric structures such as continental slopes and narrow passages in the north (2.17 GW) and ridges and seamounts south of New Caledonia (3.92 GW). The bulk of baroclinic energy is generated in shallow waters around 500 m depth and on critical to supercritical slopes, highlighting the limitations of linear semi-analytical models in those areas. Despite the strongly dominant mode-1 generation, more than 50 % of the locally generated energy either dissipates in the near field close to the generation sites or loses coherence. The remaining baroclinic energy propagates within well-defined tidal beams with baroclinic energy fluxes of up to 30 kW m<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span> toward the open ocean. The New Caledonia site represents a challenge for SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) observability of balanced motion in the presence of internal tides with sea surface height (SSH) signatures  <span class="inline-formula">&gt;6</span> cm at similar wavelengths.

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>In this study, the WRF-Chem v4.4 model was utilized to evaluate three bottom-up emission inventories (EDGAR-HTAP v2, v3, and KORUS v5) using surface and aircraft data in East Asia during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign period in 2016. All emission inventories were found to reproduce the diurnal variations of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> as compared to the surface monitor data. However, the spatial distributions of the daily maximum 8-hour average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> in the model do not completely align with the observations. The model MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> had a negative (positive) bias north (south) of 30&deg; N over China. All simulations underestimated the observed CO by 50&ndash;60 % over China and South Korea. In the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), EDGAR-HTAP v2, v3, and KORUS v5 simulated the vertical shapes and diurnal patterns of O<sub>3</sub> and other precursors effectively, but the model underestimated the observed O<sub>3</sub>, CO and HCHO concentrations. Notably, the model aromatic VOCs were significantly underestimated with the three bottom-up emission inventories, although the KORUS v5 shows improvements. The model isoprene estimations had a positive bias relative to the observations, suggesting that the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) version 2.04 overestimated isoprene emissions. Additional model simulations were conducted by doubling CO and VOC emissions over China and South Korea to investigate the causes of the model O<sub>3</sub> biases and the effects of the long-range transport on the O<sub>3</sub> over South Korea. The doubled CO and VOC emission simulations improved the model O<sub>3</sub> simulations for the local emission dominant case, but led to the model O<sub>3</sub> overestimations for the transport dominant case, which emphasizes the need for accurate representations of the local VOC emissions over South Korea.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Baseflow is the delayed component of streamflow from subsurface storage and is critical for sustaining ecological flows and ensuring water resource security. Understanding controls on and changes in baseflow, including the seasonality of baseflow, is therefore an important task. Baseflow seasonality has typically been investigated using pre-defined hydrological seasons. Instead, here, we investigate baseflow seasonality using data-led approaches that identify and cluster average annual baseflow hydrographs that exhibit early-, mid-, or late-seasonality. We apply a novel functional data analysis (FDA) approach and examine temporal changes in the timing of seasonal peaks in annual standardised baseflow hydrographs for 671 catchments across Great Britain (GB). We use data from the CAMELS-GB dataset for the period 1976 to 2015 split into two twenty-year time blocks (1976&ndash;1995 and 1996&ndash;2015). Functional clustering enables groups of catchments with similar distributions between time blocks to be identified. Changes in baseflow seasonality with time are investigated by identifying and characterising catchments that move between functional clusters and time blocks, while analysis of the timing of baseflow peaks provides additional temporal resolution to the early-, mid-, and late-season discretisation generated by the functional clustering. The analysis shows that baseflow seasonality has a spatio-temporally coherent structure across GB and catchment characteristics are a first order control on the form of seasonal baseflow clusters. Changes in climate are inferred to be the first order control on changes in baseflow seasonality between the two time blocks. A change to earlier seasonal baseflow in snow-melt influenced catchments in upland northern GB is associated with systematic warming across the two time blocks, and a move to earlier (later) baseflow seasonality across lowland southern, central and eastern (western, north-western and northern) catchments in GB is associated with earlier (later) seasonality in effective rainfall (defined as precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration). These changes in baseflow seasonality in non-snow-melt influenced catchments are consistent with the proposition that, in temperate environments, climate warming leading to vegetation phenology-mediated changes in evapotranspiration may be modifying the timing of hydrological cycles.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Infiltration process and soil moisture dynamics in response to rainfall are crucial for subsurface flow generation, landslide hazard control, and hydro-ecosystem management. Geophysical tools such as the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and self-potential (SP) method have proven useful in providing greater temporal and spatial subsurface information and making connections to water content or water flux. In this study, the combination of ERT and SP was used to enhance our understanding of water infiltration processes caused by natural rainfall, subsurface structures, and plant root distribution. We installed 100 ERT electrodes with an electrode spacing of 0.5 m on a tree-covered hillslope to conduct ERT surveys every two weeks from June to October 2022, and increase the frequency of measurements during rainfall events. Non-polarized electrodes were used to measure SP along the hillslope and at various depths. Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors were used to obtain the soil water content as an accurate reference to establish the petrophysical relationship between soil moisture and resistivity. Based on the robustness assessment of these relationships, the results suggest that the Dipole-Dipole configuration may help to obtain a more reasonable interpretation of resistivity at the forest site than the Wenner configuration. The joint interpretation of the SP and ERT results showed that water flow in the study area is dominated by vertical direction, and two preferential flow paths due to the fractured and permeable soil layer interface provide important vertical hydrological connections between deep and shallow soil layers. In addition, the subsurface infiltration processes were strongly influenced by the trees with different root characteristics. Trees with shallow roots tend to retain more water content at the surface. Deep-rooted trees absorb and store water in deeper layers, resulting in significant abrupt changes in the water content of the deeper soil layers. The results of this study provide a basis for investigating the hydrological connectivity and climate sensitivity of soil water distribution by linking rainfall with subsurface information provided by the ERT and SP.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The UMBC Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP2) will be onboard NASA&rsquo;s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, scheduled for launch in January 2024. In this study we systematically evaluate the retrievability and uncertainty of aerosol and ocean parameters from HARP2 multi-angle polarimeter (MAP) measurements. To reduce the computational demand of MAP-based retrievals and maximize data processing throughput, we developed improved neural network (NN) forward models for space-borne HARP2 measurements over a coupled atmosphere and ocean system within the FastMAPOL retrieval algorithm. A cascading retrieval scheme is further implemented in FastMAPOL, which leverages a series of NN models of varying size, speed, and accuracy to optimize performance. A full day of global synthetic HARP2 data was generated and used to test various retrieval parameters including aerosol microphysical and optical properties, aerosol layer height, ocean surface wind speed, and ocean chlorophyll-a concentration. To assess retrieval quality, pixel-wise retrieval uncertainties were derived from the Jacobians of the cost function and evaluated against the difference between the retrieval parameters and truth based on a Monte Carlo error propagation method. We found that the fine-mode aerosol properties can be retrieved well from the HARP2 data, though the coarse-mode aerosol properties are more uncertain. Larger uncertainties are also associated with a reduced number of available viewing angles, which typically occurs near the scan edge of the HARP2 instrument. Results of the performance assessment demonstrate that the algorithm is a viable approach for operational application to HARP2 data after PACE launch.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Feedforward blade pitch control is one of the most promising lidar-assisted control strategies due to its significant improvement in rotor speed regulation and fatigue load reduction. A high-quality preview of the rotor-effective wind speed is a key element to control benefits. In this work, a single-beam continuous-wave or a pulsed lidar system is simulated in the spinner of a bottom-fixed IEA 15 MW wind turbine. The single-beam lidar can rotate with the wind turbine rotor and scan the inflow with a circular pattern, which mimics a multiple-beam nacelle lidar at a lower cost. Also, the spinner-based lidar has an unimpeded view of the inflow without intermittent blockage from the rotating blade. The focus distance and the cone angle of the spinner-based single-beam lidar are optimized for the best wind preview quality based on a rotor-effective wind speed coherence model. Then, the control benefits of using the optimized spinner-based lidar are evaluated for an above-rated wind speed in OpenFAST with an embedded lidar simulator and virtual four-dimensional Mann turbulence fields considering the wind evolution. Results are compared against those using a single-beam nacelle-based lidar. We found that the optimum scanning configurations of both CW and pulsed spinner-based single-beam lidars lead to a lidar scan radius of 0.6 of the rotor radius. Also, results show that a single-beam lidar mounted in the spinner brings much more control benefits (i.e., better rotor speed regulations and higher reductions of the damage equivalent loads on the tower base and blade roots) than the one based on the nacelle. The spinner-based single-beam lidar brings similar performance as a 4-beam nacelle lidar when used for feedforward control.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Primary production dynamics are strongly associated with vertical density profiles in shelf waters. Variations in the vertical structure of the pycnocline in stratified shelf waters are likely to affect nutrient fluxes and hence the vertical distribution and production rate of phytoplankton. To understand the effects of physical changes on primary production, identifying the linkage between water column density and Chlorophyll <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> (Chl <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span>) profiles is essential. Here, the vertical distributions of density features describing three different portions of the pycnocline (the top, centre, and bottom) were compared to the vertical distribution of Chl <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> to provide auxiliary variables to estimate Chl <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> in shelf waters. The proximity of density features with deep Chl <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> maximum (DCM) was tested using the Spearman correlation, linear regression, and a major axis regression over 15 years in a shelf sea region (the northern North Sea) that exhibits stratified water columns. Out of 1237 observations, 78 % reported DCM above the bottom mixed layer depth (BMLD: depth between the bottom of the pycnocline and the mixed layer underneath) with an average distance of 2.74 <span class="inline-formula">±</span> 5.21 m from each other. BMLD acts as a vertical boundary above which subsurface Chl <span class="inline-formula"><i>a</i></span> maxima are mostly found in shelf seas (depth <span class="inline-formula">≤</span> 115 m). Overall, DCMs were correlated with the halfway pycnocline depth (HPD) (<span class="inline-formula"><i>ρ</i><sub>S</sub></span> <span class="inline-formula">=</span> 0.56) which, combined with BMLD, were better predictors of the locations of DCMs than surface mixed layer indicators and the maximum squared buoyancy frequency.

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The MEMS-based seismic network of Trentino (NE Italy) consists of 76 low-cost accelerometers installed close to inhabited areas. These sensors have a suitable sensitivity to detect moderate-to-strong earthquakes but are able to record even weaker seismicity. The densely distributed peak ground acceleration values recorded by MEMS and other types of stations are integrated within the existing seismic monitoring procedure in order to automatically obtain a complete set of strong motion parameters a few minutes after the origin time. The exposure for resident population and critical buildings is estimated by quantifying the different levels of shaking, which is expressed according to the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg intensity scale. These types of results, summarized in synthetic PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, can be useful for civil protection purposes to timely evaluate the state of emergency after a strong earthquake and to choose how and where activate first aid measures and targeted structural monitoring.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the stratospheric tropical winds influences the global circulation over a wide range of latitudes and altitudes. Although it has strong effects on surface weather and climate, climate models have great difficulties in simulating a realistic QBO, especially in the lower stratosphere. Therefore, global wind observations in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) are of particular interest for investigating the QBO and the tropical waves that contribute significantly to its driving. In our work, we focus on the years 2018–2022 and investigate the QBO and different tropical wave modes in the UTLS region using global wind observations made by the Aeolus satellite instrument and three meteorological reanalyses: the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-5), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). Further, we compare these data with observations of selected radiosonde stations. By comparison with Aeolus observations, we find that, on zonal average, the QBO in the lower stratosphere is well represented in all three reanalyses, with ERA-5 performing best. Averaged over the years 2018–2022, agreement between Aeolus and the reanalyses is better than 1 to 2 <span class="inline-formula">m</span> <span class="inline-formula">s</span><span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>, with somewhat larger differences during some periods. Differently from zonal averages, radiosonde stations provide only local observations and are therefore biased by global-scale tropical waves, which limits their use as a QBO standard. While reanalyses perform well on zonal average, there can be considerable local biases between reanalyses and radiosondes. We also find that, in the tropical UTLS, zonal wind variances of stationary waves and the most prominent global-scale traveling equatorial wave modes, such as Kelvin waves, Rossby-gravity waves, and equatorial Rossby waves, are in good agreement between Aeolus and all three reanalyses (in most cases better than 20 % of the peak values in the UTLS). On zonal average, this supports the use of reanalyses as a reference for comparison with free-running climate models, while locally, certain biases exist, particularly in the QBO wind shear zones and around the 2019–2020 QBO disruption.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Differential penetration of green laser light into snow and ice has long been considered a possible cause of range and thus elevation bias in laser altimeters. Over snow, ice, and water, green photons can penetrate the surface and experience multiple scattering events in the subsurface volume before being scattered back to the surface and subsequently the instrument&rsquo;s detector, therefore biasing the range of the measurement. Newly formed sea ice adjacent to open water leads provides an opportunity to identify differential penetration without the need for an absolute reference surface or dual color lidar data. We use co-located, coincident high-resolution natural color imagery and airborne lidar data to identify surface and ice types and evaluate elevation differences between those surfaces. The lidar data reveal that apparent elevations of thin ice and finger-rafted thin ice can be several tens of cm below the water surface of surrounding leads. These lower elevations coincide with broadening of the laser pulse suggesting that subsurface volume scattering is causing the pulse broadening and elevation shift. To complement our analysis of pulse shapes and help interpret the physical mechanism behind the observed elevation biases, we match the waveform shapes with a model of scattering of light in snow and ice that predicts the shape of lidar waveforms reflecting from snow and ice surfaces based on the shape of the transmitted pulse, the surface roughness, and the optical scattering properties of the medium. We parameterize the scattering in our model based on the scattering length <em>L<sub>scat</sub></em>, the mean distance a photon travels between isotropic scattering events. The largest scattering lengths are found for thin ice that exhibits the largest negative elevation biases, where scattering lengths of several cm allow photons to build up considerable range biases over multiple scattering events, indicating that biased elevations exist in lower-level Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) data products. Preliminary analysis of ICESat-2 ATL10 data shows that a similar relationship between subsurface elevations (restored negative freeboard) and &ldquo;pulse width&rdquo; is present in ICESat-2 data over sea ice, suggesting that biased elevations caused by differential penetration likely also exist in lower-level ICESat-2 data products. The spatial correlation of observed differential penetration in ATM data with surface and ice type suggests that elevation biases could also have a seasonal component, increasing the challenge of applying a simple bias correction.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Wind-turbine blades are complex structures and, despite advancements in analysis techniques, differences persist between predictions of their elastic response and experimental results. This undermines confidence in the ability to reliably design and certify novel blade designs that include self-regulating features like bend-twist coupling To address these discrepancies, this study investigates the influence of manufacturing tolerances on the compliance properties of blade cross-sections, focusing specifically on a previously disregarded feature: the trailing edge bond-line. To conduct this investigation, the validated cross-sectional modelling tools BECAS and VABS are used to demonstrate that even small geometric variations can have significant influence on cross-sectional stiffness properties. The results are further examined and substantiated through the utilisation of 3D finite element models, adopting both shell and solid elements. We conclude that an accurate geometric representation of the cross-section is necessary to adequately capture the shear flow within it and assure accurate predictions on cross-sectional stiffness properties.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The lithosphere&ndash;asthenosphere boundary (LAB), which can be seismically detected, stabilizes plate tectonics. Several conflicting hypotheses have been proposed as the causes of LAB discontinuity, such as the contribution of hydrated minerals, mineral anisotropy, and partial melts. The petit-spot melts ascending from the asthenosphere, owing to subducting plate flexures, support the partial melting at the LAB. Here, we observed the lava outcrops of six monogenetic volcanoes formed by petit-spot volcanism in the western Pacific. Thereafter, we determined the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages, major and trace element compositions, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios of the petit-spot basalts. The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages of two monogenetic volcanoes were ca. 2.6 Ma (million years ago) and ca. 0 Ma, respectively. The isotopic compositions of the western Pacific petit-spot basalts suggest their geochemically similar melting sources. They were likely derived from a mixture of high-&mu; (HIMU) mantle-like and enriched mantle (EM) -1-like components related to carbonatitic/carbonated materials and recycled crustal components. A mass balance-based melting model implied that the characteristic trace element composition (i.e., Zr, Hf, and Ti depletions) of the western Pacific petit-spot magmas could be explained by the partial melting of garnet lherzolite with a small degree of carbonatite melt flux with crustal components. This result confirms the involvement of carbonatite melt and recycled crust in the source of petit-spot melts and provides an implication for the genesis of tectonic-induced volcanism with similar geochemical signatures to those of petit-spots.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>A new cascade impactor has been developed with the arrangement of the classifying nozzles optimised for analysis of the collected particles by total reflection X ray fluorescence (TXRF). TXRF offers detection limits in the range of a few pg of absolute mass and therefore poses great potential for the elemental analysis of heavy metals in aerosol particles. To fully exploit this high sensitivity, particles have to be collected in the effective analysis area of the TXRF instrument, which is often smaller than typical deposition patterns of commercial impactors or filter samplers. This is achieved by a novel, compact arrangement of the classifying nozzles within a circular area of a diameter of less than 5 mm. A decreasing density of the nozzle spacing from the inside to the outside of the nozzle cluster allows for constant cross flow conditions, minimising the mutual influence of the individual nozzles. The design of a multi-stage cascade impactor is presented, to individually sample PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 size fractions. Considering the high sensitivity of TXRF analysis, constructive measures have been taken to prevent attrition of impactor material which might lead to methodical blank values. Experimental validation confirms that neither attrition nor cross-contamination can be observed. Furthermore, a new spin-coating method has been developed which makes it possible to apply a thin and defined adhesive layer of grease to the sample carrier with good repeatability. Application of the impactor in a case study at an urban site at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin, Germany shows that at a moderate sampling volume flow rate of 5 litres per minute, the particle mass collected in 30 minutes or less is sufficient for reliable TXRF analysis of heavy metal concentrations (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni) in ambient aerosol. This high time resolution enables snapshot sampling, e.g. to quantify variations in particle source strengths. Overall, the new impactor optimised for TXRF analysis bears great potential to improve the quantification of particulate trace metals and other elements in PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 with high time resolution.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Constructed Technosols are an important means of substituting natural soil material, such as peat and geogenic material, for use in urban green infrastructure. One characteristic of Technosols important to their role in urban green infrastructure, specifically with respect to urban water management, is their soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The SHPs depend on the composition of the constructed Technosols (e.g. their components and their mixing ratio). The diversity of possible components and the infinite number of mixing ratios practically prohibit the experimental identification of the composition needed to achieve suitable soil hydrological functions. In this study, we propose a compositional model for predicting the water retention curves (WRCs) of any binary mixture based on the measured WRCs of its two pure components only (basic scheme) or with one additional mixture (extended scheme). The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves (HCCs) are predicted based on the modelled WRCs. The compositional model is developed from existing methods for estimating the porosity of binary mixtures. The model was tested on four data sets of measured WRCs of different binary mixtures. The distribution of water and air in 50 cm high soil columns filled with these mixtures was predicted under hydrostatic conditions in order to assess their suitability for typical urban applications. The difference between the maxima of the pore size distributions <span class="inline-formula">ΔPSD<sub>max</sub></span> (m) of the components indicates the applicability of the compositional approach. For binary mixtures with small <span class="inline-formula">ΔPSD<sub>max</sub></span>, the water content deviations between the predicted and the measured WRCs range from 0.004 to 0.039 cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>3</sup></span> cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−3</sup></span>. For mixtures with a large <span class="inline-formula">ΔPSD<sub>max</sub></span>, the compositional model is not applicable. The prediction of the soil hydraulic properties of any mixing ratio facilitates the simulation of flow and transport processes in constructed Technosols before they are produced (e.g. for specific urban water management purposes).</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Long-range weather forecasts provide predictions of atmospheric, ocean and land surface conditions that can potentially be used in land surface and hydrological models to predict the water and energy status of the land surface or in crop growth models to predict yield for water resources or agricultural planning. However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of available forecast products have hindered their widespread use in such modelling applications, which usually require high-resolution input data. In this study, we applied sub-seasonal (up to 4 months) and seasonal (7 months) weather forecasts from the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in a land surface modelling approach using the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5). Simulations were conducted for 2017–2020 forced with sub-seasonal and seasonal weather forecasts over two different domains with contrasting climate and cropping conditions: the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC). We found that, after pre-processing of the forecast products (i.e. temporal downscaling of precipitation and incoming short-wave radiation), the simulations forced with seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts were able to provide a model output that was very close to the reference simulation results forced by reanalysis data (the mean annual crop yield showed maximum differences of 0.28 and 0.36 t ha<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span> for AUS-VIC and DE-NRW respectively). Differences between seasonal and sub-seasonal experiments were insignificant. The forecast experiments were able to satisfactorily capture recorded inter-annual variations of crop yield. In addition, they also reproduced the generally higher inter-annual differences in crop yield across the AUS-VIC domain (approximately 50 % inter-annual differences in recorded yields and up to 17 % inter-annual differences in simulated yields) compared to the DE-NRW domain (approximately 15 % inter-annual differences in recorded yields and up to 5 % in simulated yields). The high- and low-yield seasons (2020 and 2018) among the 4 simulated years were clearly reproduced in the forecast simulation results. Furthermore, sub-seasonal and seasonal simulations reflected the early harvest in the drought year of 2018 in the DE-NRW domain. However, simulated inter-annual yield variability was lower in all simulations compared to the official statistics. While general soil moisture trends, such as the European drought in 2018, were captured by the seasonal experiments, we found systematic overestimations and underestimations in both the forecast and reference simulations compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 soil moisture product (SMAP L3) and the Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative Combined dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA CCI). These observed biases of soil moisture and the low inter-annual differences in simulated crop yield indicate the need to improve<span id="page3144"/> the representation of these variables in CLM5 to increase the model sensitivity to drought stress and other crop stressors.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Solving the momentum balance is the computationally expensive part of simulating the evolution of ice sheets. The momentum balance is described by the nonlinear full-Stokes equations. As a nonlinear problem, they are solved iteratively. We solve these equations with Newton's method. We obtain global superlinear convergence by using a step size control. For the step size control, we need a minimization problem. Solving the full-Stokes equations is equivalent to minimizing a specific convex function. We use the Armijo and the exact step sizes for Newton's method. Additionally, we use the exact step sizes for the Picard iteration. Finally, we compare the Picard iteration and the variants of Newton's method in two benchmark experiments, called ISMIP-HOM experiments A and B. These experiments consist of a more realistic domain and are designed to test the quality of ice models. We obtain that Newton's method and the Picard iteration with exact step sizes greatly reduce the necessary number of iterations.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Statistical methods, particularly machine learning models, have gained significant popularity in air quality predictions. These prediction models are commonly trained using the historical measurement datasets independently collected at the environmental monitoring stations and their operational forecasts in advance using inputs of the real-time ambient pollutant observations. Therefore, these high-quality machine learning models only provide site-available predictions and cannot solely be used as the operational forecast. In contrast, deterministic chemical transport models (CTMs), which simulate the full life cycles of air pollutants, provide predictions that are continuous in the 3D field. Despite their benefits, CTM predictions are typically biased, particularly on a fine scale, owing to the complex error sources due to the emission, transport, and removal of pollutants. In this study, we proposed a fusion of site-available machine learning prediction, which is from our regional feature selection-based machine learning model (RFSML v1.0), and a CTM prediction. Compared to the normal pure machine learning model, the fusion system provides a gridded prediction with relatively high accuracy. The prediction fusion was conducted using the Bayesian-theory-based ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Background error covariance was an essential part in the assimilation process. Ensemble CTM predictions driven by the perturbed emission inventories were initially used for representing their spatial covariance statistics, which could resolve the main part of the CTM error. In addition, a covariance inflation algorithm was designed to amplify the ensemble perturbations to account for other model errors next to the uncertainty in emission inputs. Model evaluation tests were conducted based on independent measurements. Our EnKF-based prediction fusion presented superior performance compared to the pure CTM. Moreover, covariance inflation further enhanced the fused prediction, particularly in cases of severe underestimation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p><span id="page3932"/>Our global understanding of clouds and aerosols relies on the remote sensing of their optical, microphysical, and macrophysical properties using, in part, scattered solar radiation. Current retrievals assume clouds and aerosols form plane-parallel, homogeneous layers and utilize 1D radiative transfer (RT) models. These assumptions limit the detail that can be retrieved about the 3D variability in the cloud and aerosol fields and induce biases in the retrieved properties for highly heterogeneous structures such as cumulus clouds and smoke plumes. In Part 1 of this two-part study, we validated a tomographic method that utilizes multi-angle passive imagery to retrieve 3D distributions of species using 3D RT to overcome these issues. That validation characterized the uncertainty in the approximate Jacobian used in the tomographic retrieval over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions for several horizontal boundary conditions. Here, in Part 2, we test the algorithm's effectiveness on synthetic data to test whether the retrieval accuracy is limited by the use of the approximate Jacobian. We retrieve 3D distributions of a volume extinction coefficient <span class="inline-formula">(<i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub>)</span> at 40 m resolution from synthetic multi-angle, mono-spectral imagery at 35 m resolution derived from stochastically generated cumuliform-type clouds in (1 km)<span class="inline-formula"><sup>3</sup></span> domains. The retrievals are idealized in that we neglect forward-modelling and instrumental errors, with the exception of radiometric noise; thus, reported retrieval errors are the lower bounds. <span class="inline-formula"><i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub></span> is retrieved with, on average, a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) <span class="inline-formula">&lt;</span> 20 % and bias <span class="inline-formula">&lt;</span> 0.1 % for clouds with maximum optical depth (MOD) <span class="inline-formula">&lt;</span> 17, and the RRMSE of the radiances is <span class="inline-formula">&lt;</span> 0.5 %, indicating very high accuracy in shallow cumulus conditions. As the MOD of the clouds increases to 80, the RRMSE and biases in <span class="inline-formula"><i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub></span> worsen to 60 % and <span class="inline-formula">−</span>35 %, respectively, and the RRMSE of the radiances reaches 16 %, indicating incomplete convergence. This is expected from the increasing ill-conditioning of the inverse problem with the decreasing mean free path predicted by RT theory and discussed in detail in Part 1. We tested retrievals that use a forward model that is not only less ill-conditioned (in terms of condition number) but also less accurate, due to more aggressive delta-M scaling. This reduces the radiance RRMSE to 9 % and the bias in <span class="inline-formula"><i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub></span> to <span class="inline-formula">−</span>8 % in clouds with MOD <span class="inline-formula">∼</span> 80, with no improvement in the RRMSE of <span class="inline-formula"><i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub></span>. This illustrates a significant sensitivity of the retrieval to the numerical configuration of the RT model which, at least in our circumstances, improves the retrieval accuracy. All of these ensemble-averaged results are robust in response to the inclusion of radiometric noise during the retrieval. However, individual realizations can have large deviations of up to 18 % in the mean extinction in clouds with MOD <span class="inline-formula">∼</span> 80, which indicates large uncertainties in the retrievals in the optically thick limit. Using less ill-conditioned forward model tomography can also accurately infer optical depths (ODs) in conditions spanning the majority of oceanic cumulus fields (MOD <span class="inline-formula">&lt;</span> 80), as the retrieval provides ODs with bias and RRMSE values better than <span class="inline-formula">−</span>8 % and 36 %, respectively. This is a significant improvement over retrievals using 1D RT, which have OD biases between <span class="inline-formula">−</span>30 % and <span class="inline-formula">−</span>23 % and RRMSE between 29 % and 80 % for the clouds used here. Prior information or other sources of information will be required to improve the RRMSE of <span class="inline-formula"><i>σ</i><sub>3D</sub></span> in the optically thick limit, where the RRMSE is shown to have a strong spatial structure that varies with the solar and viewing geometry.</p>]]></dc:description>

Near-daily observations of the surface elevation changes from a permanent terrestrial laser scanning set-up allowed the determination of the day when the mass balance of Hintereisferner started to become negative. This Glacier Loss Day (GLD) was already reached on 23 June in 2022 and gave way to a long ice ablation period. In 2021/2022, this and the high cumulative positive degree days explain the record-breaking mass loss. By comparing the GLDs of 2019/2020–2021/2022, we found a gross yet expressive indicator of the glacier's imbalance with the persistently warming climate.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The present work describes the implementation of the state of the art Cloud-<em>J</em> v7.3 photolysis rate calculation code in the EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model. Cloud-<em>J</em> calculates photolysis rates and accounts for cloud and aerosol optical properties at model run-time, replacing the old system based on tabulated values. The performance of Cloud-<em>J</em> is evaluated against aerial photolysis rate observations made over the Pacific Ocean, and against surface observations from three measurement sites in Europe. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated photolysis rates to the spatial and temporal model resolution, input meteorology model, simulated ozone column, and cloud effect parameterization. These experiments indicate that the calculated photolysis rates are most sensitive to the choice of input meteorology model and cloud effect parameterization, while also showing that surface ozone photolysis rates can vary by up to 20 % due to daily variations in total ozone column. Further analysis investigates the impact of Cloud-<em>J</em> on the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere, aerosol radiative effect, and surface air quality predictions. Results find that the total tropospheric hydroxyl budget is increased by 26 %, while the radiative impact of aerosols is mostly limited to large tropical biomass burning regions. Overall, Cloud-<em>J</em> represents a major improvement over the tabulated system, leading to improved model performance for predicting carbon monoxide and daily maximum ozone surface concentrations. The bias is worsened for nitrogen dioxide, however, possibly hinting at model shortcomings elsewhere.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>This paper presents the extension of industry modelling within the REMIND integrated assessment model to industry subsectors, and the projection of future industry subsector activity and energy demand for different baseline scenarios for use with the REMIND model. The industry sector is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting energy demand sector and considered a mitigation bottleneck. At the same time, industry subsectors are heterogeneous and face distinct emission mitigation challenges. By extending the multi-region, general equilibrium integrated assessment model REMIND to an explicit representation of four industry subsectors (cement, chemicals, steel, and other industry production), along with subsector-specific carbon captrure and sequestration (CCS), we are able to investigate industry emission mitigation strategies in the context of the entire energy-economy-climate system, covering mitigation options ranging from reduced demand for industrial goods, over fuel switching and electrification, to endogenous energy efficiency increases and carbon capture. We also present the derivation of both activity and final energy demand trajectories for the industry subsectors for the use with the REMIND model in baseline scenarios, based on short-term the continuation of historic trends and long-term global convergence. The system allows for selective variation of specific subsector activity and final energy demand across scenarios and regions to create consistent scenarios for a wide range of socioeconomic drivers and scenario story lines, like the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>DINOSTRAT version 2.0-GTS2020 is now available (Bijl et al., 2023a; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7791273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7791273</a>). This version updates DINOSTRAT to the Geologic Time Scale 2020, and new publications are added into the database. The resulting database now contains over 9,450 entries from 209 sites. This update has not led to major and profound changes in the conclusions made previously. DINOSTRAT allows full presentation of first and last stratigraphic occurrences of dinocyst (sub-) families, as well as the evolutionary turnover throughout geologic history, as a reliable representation of dinoflagellate evolution. Although the picture of dinoflagellate evolution from DINOSTRAT is broadly consistent with that in previous publications, the underlying data is with DINOSTRAT openly available, reproducible, and up to date. This release of DINOSTRAT allows calibration of stratigraphic records to the Geologic Time Scale 2020 using dinoflagellate cysts as biostratigraphic tool.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p><span id="page9474"/>Ammonia (NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span>) is the most abundant alkaline component in the atmosphere. Changes in NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> concentrations have important implications for atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and ecosystem integrity. We present a long-term ammonia (NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span>) assessment in the western and central African regions within the framework of the International Network to study Deposition and Atmospheric chemistry in Africa (INDAAF) programme. We analyse seasonal variations and trends in NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> concentrations and total column densities along an African ecosystem transect spanning dry savannas in Banizoumbou, Niger, and Katibougou, Mali; wet savannas in Djougou, Benin, and Lamto, Côte d'Ivoire; and forests in Bomassa, Republic of the Congo, and Zoétélé, Cameroon. We use a 21-year record of observations (1998–2018) from INDAAF passive samplers and an 11-year record of observations (2008–2018) of atmospheric vertical column densities from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) to evaluate NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> ground-based concentrations and total column densities, respectively. Climatic data (air temperature, rainfall amount, and leaf area index), as well as ammonia emission data of biomass combustion from the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4) and anthropogenic sources from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS), were compared with total NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> concentrations and total columns over the same periods. Annual mean ground-based NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> concentrations are around 5.7–5.8 ppb in dry savannas, 3.5–4.7 ppb in wet savannas, and 3.4–5.6 ppb in forests. Annual IASI NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> total column densities are 10.0–10.7 <span class="inline-formula">×</span> 10<span class="inline-formula"><sup>15</sup></span> molec. cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span> in dry savanna, 16.0–20.9 <span class="inline-formula">×</span> 10<span class="inline-formula"><sup>15</sup></span> molec. cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span> in wet savanna, and 12.4–13.8 <span class="inline-formula">×</span> 10<span class="inline-formula"><sup>15</sup></span> molec. cm<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−2</sup></span> in forest stations. Non-parametric statistical Mann–Kendall trend tests applied to annual data show that ground-based NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> concentrations increase at Bomassa (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>2.56 % yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>) but decrease at Zoétélé (<span class="inline-formula">−</span>2.95 % yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>) over the 21-year period. The 11-year period of IASI NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> total column density measurements show yearly increasing trends at Katibougou (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>3.46 % yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>), Djougou (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>2.24 % yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>), and Zoétélé (<span class="inline-formula">+</span>3.42 % yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>). From the outcome of our investigation, we conclude that air temperature, leaf area index, and rainfall combined with biomass burning, agricultural, and residential activities are the key drivers of atmospheric NH<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span> in the INDAAF stations. The results also show that the drivers of trends are (1) agriculture in the dry savanna of Katibougou; (2) air temperature and agriculture in the wet savanna of Djougou and Lamto; and (3) leaf area index, air temperature, residential, and agriculture in the forest of Bomassa.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the existing published data on the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB) arthritis involving native joints in adults aged 18 years and older. <strong>Methods</strong>: This study was performed in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). <strong>Results</strong>: The systematic review of the literature yielded 20 data sources involving 573 patients from nine countries. There was considerable variation amongst the studies in terms of the approach to diagnosis and management. The diagnosis was mostly made by microbiological tissue culture. Medical management involved a median of 12 months of anti-tubercular treatment (interquartile range, IQR, of 8–16; range of 4–18 months). The duration of preoperative treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Surgery was performed on 87 % of patients and varied from arthroscopic debridement to complete synovectomies combined with total joint arthroplasty. The mean follow-up time of all studies was 26 months (range of 3–112 months). Recurrence rates were reported in most studies, with an overall average recurrence rate of approximately 7.4 % (35 of 475 cases). <strong>Conclusions</strong>: The current literature on TB arthritis highlights the need for the establishment of standardized guidelines for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Further research is needed to define the optimal approach to medical and surgical treatment. The role of early debridement in active TB arthritis needs to be explored further. Specifically, comparative studies are required to address questions around the use of medical treatment alone vs. in combination with surgical intervention.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the marine atmosphere represents an important natural source of non-sea-salt sulfate aerosol, but the chemical mechanisms underlying this process remain uncertain. While recent studies have focused on the role of the peroxy-radical isomerization channel in DMS oxidation, this work revisits the impact of the other channels (OH addition, OH abstraction followed by bimolecular RO<sub>2</sub> reaction) on aerosol formation from DMS. Due to the presence of common intermediate species, the oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) can shed light on these two DMS reaction channels; they are also both atmospherically relevant species in their own right. This work examines the OH-oxidation of DMSO and DMDS, using chamber experiments monitored by chemical ionization mass spectrometry and aerosol mass spectrometry to study the full-range of sulfur-containing products under low- and high-NO conditions. The oxidation of both compounds is found to lead to rapid aerosol formation (which does not involve the intermediate formation of SO<sub>2</sub>), with a substantial fraction (14&ndash;47 % S yield for DMSO, and 5&ndash;21 % for DMDS) of reacted sulfur ending up in the particle phase, and the highest yields observed under elevated NO conditions. Aerosol is observed to consist mainly of sulfate, methanesulfonic acid, and methanesulfinic acid. In the gas phase, the NO<sub>X</sub> dependence of several products, including SO<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>-containing organosulfur species, suggest reaction pathways not included in current mechanisms. Based on the commonalities with the DMS oxidation mechanism, DMSO and DMDS results are used to reconstruct DMS aerosol yields; these reconstructions roughly match DMS aerosol yield measurements from the literature but differ in composition, underscoring remaining uncertainties in sulfur chemistry. This work indicates that both the abstraction and addition channels contribute substantially to rapid aerosol formation from DMS, and highlights the need for more study into the fate of small sulfur radical intermediates (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) that play central roles in the DMS oxidation mechanism.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere is an important climate driver, causing solar dimming in the years after major volcanic eruptions. Hence, a growing number of general circulation models are adapting interactive sulfur and aerosol schemes to improve the representation of relevant chemical processes and associated feedbacks. However, uncertainties of these schemes are not well constrained. Stratospheric sulfate is modulated by natural emissions of sulfur-containing species, including volcanic eruptive, and anthropogenic emissions. Model intercomparisons have examined the effects of volcanic eruptions, whereas the background conditions of the sulfur cycle have not been addressed in a global model intercomparison project. Assessing background conditions in global models allows us to identify model discrepancies as they are masked by large perturbations such as volcanic eruptions, yet may still matter in the aftermath of such a disturbance.</p> <p>Here, we analyze the atmospheric burden, seasonal cycle, and vertical and meridional distribution of the main sulfur species among nine global atmospheric aerosol models that are widely used in the stratospheric aerosol research community. We use observational and reanalysis data to evaluate model results. Overall, models agree that the three dominant sulfur species in terms of burdens (sulfate aerosol, OCS, and SO<sub>2</sub>) make up about 98 % of stratospheric sulfur and 95 % of tropospheric sulfur. However, models vary considerably in the partitioning between these species. Models agree that anthropogenic emission of SO<sub>2</sub> strongly affects the sulfate aerosol burden in the Northern Hemispheric troposphere, while its importance is very uncertain in other regions. The total deposition of sulfur varies among models, deviating by a factor of two, but models agree that sulfate aerosol is the main form in which sulfur is deposited. Additionally, the partitioning between wet and dry deposition fluxes is highly model dependent. We investigate the areas of greatest variability in the sulfur species burdens and find that inter-model variability is low in the tropics and increases towards the poles. Seasonality in the southern hemisphere is depicted very similar among models. Differences are largest in the dynamically active northern hemispheric extratropical region, hence some of the differences could be attributed to the differences in the representation of the stratospheric circulation among underlying general circulation models. This study highlights that the differences in the atmospheric sulfur budget among the models arise from the representation of both chemical and dynamical processes, whose interplay complicates the bias attribution. Several problematic points identified for individual models are related to the specifics of the chemistry schemes, model resolution, and representation of cross-tropopause transport in the extratropics. Further model intercomparison research is needed focusing on the clarification of the reasons for biases, given also the importance of this topic for the stratospheric aerosol injection studies.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>A Ms6.8 strike-slip earthquake (EQ) occurred in Luding, Sichuan province, China, on 5 September, 2022, causing great losses to the surrounding Ganzi Prefecture and Ya&rsquo;an City. In this research, the near-surface atmospheric electric field (AEF), recorded at four discretely distributed sites 15d before the Luding EQ, were analyzed and discriminated by using multi-source auxiliary data including precipitation, cloud base height and low cloud cover, and nine possible seismic AEF anomalies at four sites were obtained preliminarily. Accordingly, surface microwave brightness temperature (MBT), which is very sensitive to the surface dielectrics and closely related to the air ionization, together with surface soil moisture, lithology, and 3D-simulated crustal stress field, was jointly analyzed for confirming the seismic relations of the obtained negative AEF anomalies. The geophysical environment for crustal high-stress concentration, positive charge carriers transfer and surface accumulation was demonstrated to exist and satisfy the conditions of generating locally the negative AEF anomalies. Furthermore, to deal with the spatial disparities in sites and regions with potential atmospheric ionization, the data of near-surface wind field was employed to scrutinize the reliability of the AEF anomalies by comprehensively considering the spatial relationships among surface charges accumulation areas, wind direction and speed, as well as the AEF site. Finally, four negative AEF anomalies were deemed to be closely related to the Luding EQ, and the remaining five anomalies were ruled out. The mechanism of negative AEF anomalies before the Luding EQ were believed to be: positive charge carriers were generated from the underground high stress concentration areas, and then transferred to and accumulated on the ground surface and to ionize the surface air, thus disturbing the aground AEF. This study offers an approach to identify and analyze the seismic AEF anomalies, and is also helpful to study the pre-shocking coupling process between coversphere and atmosphere.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) is a technique commonly used to measure ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban, rural, and remote environments. PTR-ToF-MS is known to produce artifacts from ion fragmentation, which complicates the interpretation and quantification of key atmospheric VOCs. This study evaluates the extent to which fragmentation and other ionization processes impacts urban measurements of the PTR-ToF-MS ions typically assigned to isoprene (m/z 69, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>H<sup>+</sup>), acetaldehyde (m/z 45, CH<sub>3</sub>CHO<sup>+</sup>), and benzene (m/z 79, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>H<sup>+</sup>). Interferences from fragmentation are identified using gas-chromatography (GC) pre-separation and the impact of these interferences are quantified using ground-based and airborne measurements in a number of US cities, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York City, and Detroit. In urban regions with low biogenic isoprene emissions (e.g., Las Vegas), fragmentation from higher carbon aldehydes and cycloalkanes emitted from anthropogenic sources may contribute to m/z 69 by as much as 50 % during the day, while the majority of the signal at m/z 69 is attributed to fragmentation during the night. Interferences are a higher fraction of m/z 69 during airborne studies, which likely results from differences in the reactivity between isoprene and the interfering species along with the subsequent changes to the VOC mixture at higher altitudes. For other PTR masses, including m/z 45 and m/z 79, interferences are observed due to the fragmentation and secondary ionization of VOCs typically used in solvents, which are becoming a more important source of anthropogenic VOCs in urban areas. We present methods to correct these interferences, which provide better agreement with GC measurements of isomer specific molecules. These observations show the utility of deploying GC pre-separation for the interpretation PTR-ToF-MS spectra.</p>]]></dc:description>

Firstly, through vehicle noise tests, poor working conditions and noise contribution of each gear pair were determined with the order analysis method. Secondly, a dynamics calculation model and a simulation model of the gear transmission system were established and the poor meshing state of the main reducer gear pair under specific conditions was determined as the main cause of noise. Finally, a genetic algorithm combined the weight method was used for gear modification. After gear modifications, the fluctuation range of transmission error was reduced and the contact condition of the tooth surface was significantly improved.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Peatlands store disproportionally large amounts of carbon per unit area, a function that is dependent on maintaining high and stable water tables. Climate change is likely to negatively impact carbon storage in peatlands, in part due to increases in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) driving higher evaporation (<em>E</em>) rates. However, the response of <em>E</em> to increasing VPD depends on the dominant vegetation type within peatlands. In this study, we used multiple years of eddy covariance (EC) measurements to compare <em>E</em> regimes at two peatlands with contrasting vegetation types &ndash; Kopuatai bog in Aotearoa New Zealand, dominated by the vascular jointed wire rush <em>Empodisma robustum</em>, and Mer Bleue bog in Canada, a &lsquo;typical&rsquo; shrub and moss-dominated Northern Hemisphere peatland. We examined seasonal variability in <em>E</em> and equilibrium <em>E</em> (<em>E</em><sub>eq</sub>), energy balance partitioning, and the response of E, evaporative fraction (EF), and canopy conductance (<em>g</em><sub>c</sub>) to VPD. Mean annual <em>E</em> was 45 % lower than mean annual <em>E</em><sub>eq</sub> at Kopuatai, but only 16 % lower at Mer Bleue, demonstrating much greater limitations on <em>E</em> at Kopuatai. In addition, the mean midday (10:00&ndash;14:30) dry canopy Bowen ratio (<em>&beta;</em>) at Kopuatai was 1.96, compared to 0.77 at Mer Bleue; therefore, the sensible heat flux (<em>H</em>) dominated over the latent heat flux (<em>LE</em>) at Kopuatai, and vice versa at Mer Bleue. The responses of <em>E</em>, EF, and <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> to increasing VPD at Kopuatai differed from those at Mer Bleue in a way that resulted in stronger limitations on <em>E</em> above ~0.7 kPa at the former bog. The observed limitations at Kopuatai were attributed to strong stomatal control by <em>E. robustum</em> due to the rapid decrease in <em>g</em><sub>c</sub> with increasing VPD, however surface <em>E</em> could also be limited by its dense standing litter. At Mer Bleue, however, <em>E</em> was only weakly limited at VPD &gt; 2 kPa, likely due to weak stomatal control over transpiration by the sparse shrub canopy and relatively large surface <em>E</em> from Sphagnum carpets. As such, the results of this study suggest that <em>E. robustum</em> drives a greater &ldquo;hydrological resistance&rdquo; to increasing VPD than the vegetation at Mer Bleue, leading to greater water retention at Kopuatai. This may enable greater resilience of the carbon sink function at Kopuatai to climatic warming and drying than at Mer Bleue.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>In this work, an ensemble inventory (median) is created with the aim of monitoring the status and progress made with the development of Europe-wide inventories. This ensemble inventory also allows comparing a large number of inventories at the same time, foster interactions among emission inventory developers and allow for comparing additional inventories (e.g. bottom-up ones) with all ensemble components. In contrast with other fields of applications (e.g. air quality forecast), this emission ensemble is not necessarily better than any of its components. Although it is not the more accurate inventory, it serves here as a common benchmark for the screening. We focus on differences in terms of country totals, country sectorial share and share of the country emissions to the urban areas for emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, PM2.5, PM coarse, NMVOC, SO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. Because the emission &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is unknown, the approach does not tell which inventory is the closest to reality. The methodology rather screens differences between inventories, excludes differences that are not relevant and identifies among the remaining ones, those that are larger than a given threshold, and need special attention. The underlying concept is that above this threshold, differences are so large that one or both inventories must be checked.</p> <p>The analysis of the ensemble and the comparison with its individual components highlight a large number of inconsistencies. While two of the three inventories behave more closely to each other (CAMS-REG and EMEP), they yet show inconsistencies in terms of the spatial distribution of emissions. These differences mostly occur for SO<sub>2</sub>, PM and NMVOC, for the industrial and residential sectors, and reach a factor 10 in some instances. Necessary improvements have been identified, in particular with EDGAR with the PM emissions from the small-scale combustion sector and SO<sub>2</sub> from the industry and power plant sectors. The comparison with the local inventory for Poland leads to identifying another type of inconsistencies, associated to the sectorial share at country level. This is explained by the fact that some emission sources are omitted in the local inventory due to the lacking of appropriate geographically allocated activity data. The screening process led to identify some sectors and pollutants for which discussion between local and EU-wide emission compilers would be needed in order to reduce the magnitude of the observed differences (e.g. in the residential and industrial sectors). The settings used in this work (e.g. the choice of 150 urban areas or the way sectors are aggregated) are arbitrarily fixed and can easily be adapted for the purpose of other comparisons.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The rural-to-urban transformation (RUT) is the process of turning rural or natural land-surface into urban one which brings important modifications in the surface causing well know effects like the urban heat island (UHI), reduced wind-speeds, increased boundary layer heights and so on. Moreover, with concentrated human activities RUT introduces new emission source which greatly perturbs the local and regional air-pollution. Particulate matter (PM) is one of key pollutants responsible for deterioration of urban air-quality and is still a major issue in European cities with frequent exceedances of limit values. Here we introduce a regional chemistry-climate model (regional climate model RegCM coupled offline to chemistry transport model CAMx) study which quantifies how the process of RUT modified the PM concentrations over central Europe including the underlying controlling mechanisms that contribute to the final PM pollution. Apart from the two most studied ones, i) the urban emissions and ii) the urban canopy meteorological forcing (UCMF, i.e. the impact of modified meteorological conditions on air-quality) we analyze also two less studied contributors to the RUT&rsquo;s impact on air-quality: iii) the impact of modified dry-deposition velocities due to urbanized land-use and iv) the impact of modified biogenic emissions due to urbanization induced vegetation modifications and changes in meteorological conditions which affect these emissions. To calculate the magnitude of each of these RUT contributors, we perform a cascade of simulations were each contributor is added one-by-one to the reference state while focus is given on PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less then 2.5 &micro;m). We also look at their primary and secondary components, namely primary elemental carbon (PEC), sulphates (PSO4), nitrates (PNO3), ammonium (PNH4) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).</p> <p>The validation using surface measurements showed a systematic negative bias for the total PM2.5 which is probably caused by underestimated organic aerosol and partly by the negative bias in sulphates and elemental carbon. For ammonium and nitrate, the underestimation is limited to the warm season while for winter, the model tends to overestimate their concentrations. However, in each case, the annual cycle is reasonably captured.</p> <p>We evaluated the RUT impact on PM2.5 over an ensemble of 19 central European cities and found that the total impact of urbanization is about 2&ndash;3 and 1&ndash;1.5 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in winter and summer, respectively. This is mainly driven by the impact of emissions alone causing a slightly higher impact (1.5&ndash;3.5 and 1.2&ndash;2 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in winter and summer), while the effect of UCMF was a decrease at about 0.2&ndash;0.5 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> (in both seasons) which was mainly controlled by enhanced vertical eddy-diffusion while increases were modelled over rural areas. The transformation of rural land-use into urban one caused an increase of dry-deposition velocities by around 30&ndash;50 % which alone resulted in a decrease of PM2.5 by 0.1&ndash;0.25 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> in both seasons. Finally, the impact of biogenic emission modification due to modified land-use and meteorological conditions caused a decrease of summer PM2.5 of about 0.1 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> while the winter effects were negligible. The total impact of urbanization on aerosol components is modelled to be (values indicate winter and summer averages) 0.4 and 0.3 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> for PEC, 0.05 and 0.02 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> for PSO4, 0.1 and 0.08 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> for PNO3, 0.04 and 0.03 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> for PNH4 and 0 and 0.05 &micro;gm<sup>&minus;3</sup> for SOA. The main contributor of each of these components was the impact of emissions which was usually larger than the total impact due to the fact that UCMF counteracted with a decrease. For each aerosol component the impact of modified DV was a clear decrease of concentration and finally, the modifications of biogenic emissions impacted predominantly SOA causing a summer decrease while a very small secondary effect of secondary inorganic aerosol was modelled too (they increased).</p> <p>In summary, we showed that when analyzing the impact of urbanization on PM pollution, apart from the impact of emissions and the urban canopy meteorological forcing, one has to consider also the effect of modified land-use and its impact on dry-deposition. These were shown to be important in both seasons. For the effect of modified biogenic emissions, our calculations showed that it acts on PM2.5 predominantly trough SOA modifications which turned to be important only during summer.</p>]]></dc:description>

Astrochronology uses the geologic record of astronomically derived oscillations in the rock record to measure the passage of time and has proven a valuable technique for developing age-depth models with high spatial-temporal resolution. However, in the absence of anchoring dates, many astrochronologies float in numerical time. Anchoring these chronologies relies on radioisotope geochronology (e.g., U-Pb, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar), which produce high-precision, randomly distributed point estimates of age.</p> <p>In this study, we present a new R package, astroBayes for a Bayesian inversion of astrochronology and radioisotopic geochronology into age-depth models. Integrating both data types allows reduction in uncertainties related to interpolation between dated horizons, and the resolution of subtle changes in sedimentation rate, especially when compared to existing Bayesian models that use a stochastic random walk to approximate sedimentation variability. The <em>astroBayes</em> inversion also incorporates prior information about sedimentation rate, superposition, and the presence/ absence of major hiatuses. The resulting age-depth models preserve both the spatial resolution of floating astrochronologies, and the accuracy and precision of modern radioisotopic geochronology.</p> <p>We test the <em>astroBayes</em> method using two synthetic data sets designed to mimic real-world stratigraphic sections. Model uncertainties are relatively constant with depth, and predominantly controlled by the precision of the radioisotopic dates and are significantly reduced relative to &ldquo;dates-only&rdquo; random walk models. Since the resulting age-depth models leverage both astrochronology and radioisotopic geochronology in a single statistical framework they can resolve ambiguities between the two chronometers. Finally, we present a case study of the Bridge Creek Limestone Member of the Greenhorn Formation where we refine the age of the Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Forest net primary productivity (NPP), representing the biomass carbon gain from the atmosphere, varies significantly with forest age. Reliable forest NPP-age relationships are essential for forest carbon cycle modelling and prediction. These relationships can be derived from forest inventory or field survey data, but it is unclear which model is the most effective for simulating forest NPP variation with age. Here, we aim to establish NPP-age relationships for China&rsquo;s forests based on 3121 field survey samples. Five models, including the Semi-Empirical Mathematical (SEM) function, the Second-Degree Polynomial (SDP) function, the Logarithmic (L) function, the Michaelis-Menten (M) function, and the &Gamma; function, were compared against field data. Results of the comparison showed that the SEM and the &Gamma; function performed much better than the other three models. SEM also outperformed the &Gamma; function in tracking forest NPP-age curves at old ages and therefore is regarded as the best NPP-age model. The finalized forest NPP-age curves for five forest types in six regions of China can facilitate forest carbon modelling and future carbon projections in China and may also be useful for other regions.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Winter fog and severe aerosol loading in the boundary layer over north India, especially in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), cause disruption in the daily lives of millions of people in the region. To understand better the role of atmospheric aerosols on the occurrence, spatial extent, and persistence of winter fog in the IGP, several model simulations have been performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). Results from WRF-Chem represented relative humidity (RH) and fog formation in agreement with observations when using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data as meteorological initial/boundary conditions and soil nudging were applied. WRF-Chem successfully simulates the spatial distribution and magnitude of PM<sub>2.5</sub> when evaluated with observations from the Central Pollution Control Board of India (CPCB) monitoring network. However, the aerosol composition predicted by WRF-Chem was quite different from measurements obtained during the Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX) in Delhi, with chloride aerosol fraction being strongly underpredicted (~66.6 %). By investigating a fog event on December 23&ndash;24, 2017 over central IGP, we found that the aerosol-radiation feedback weakens turbulence, lowers the boundary layer height, and increases PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and RH within the boundary layer. The increase in RH is found to be important for fog formation and it promoted the growth of aerosol size and increased aerosol activation in the polluted environment over IGP. Loss of aerosols through deposition of cloud droplets is found to be a significant aerosol loss process during fog. The internal mixing of absorbing aerosols and hygroscopic growth reduces the single scattering albedo impacting aerosol-radiation feedbacks. Aqueous-phase chemistry increases the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations during fog events which subsequently participates in aerosol-radiation feedback. With aerosol-radiation interaction and aqueous phase chemistry, fog formation began 1&ndash;2 hours earlier and caused a longer fog duration than when these processes were not included in the WRF-Chem simulation. These processes were also found to increase RH, stabilize the boundary layer, increase PM<sub>2.5</sub> promoting aerosol activation, and thus increasing the fog water content over IGP. This suggests that the aerosol-radiation feedback and secondary aerosols play an important role in the air quality and in the intensity and lifetime of fog over IGP.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon (C) budget by sequestering a large fraction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and by acting as important methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) sinks. The forest-floor greenhouse gas (GHG; CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and nitrous oxide N<sub>2</sub>O) flux, i.e., from soil and understory vegetation, is one of the major components to consider when determining the C budget of forests. Although winter fluxes are essential to determine the annual C budget, only very few studies have examined long-term, year-round forest-floor GHG fluxes. Thus, we aimed to i) quantify the seasonal and annual variations of forest-floor GHG fluxes; ii) evaluate their drivers, including the effects of snow cover, timing, and amount of snow melt, and iii) calculate annual budgets of forest-floor GHG fluxes for a subalpine spruce forest in Switzerland. We measured GHG fluxes year-round during four years with four automatic large chambers at the ICOS Class 1 Ecosystem station Davos (CH-Dav). We applied random forest models to investigate environmental drivers and to gap-fill the flux time series. Annual and seasonal forest-floor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions responded most strongly to soil temperature and snow depth (2.34&plusmn;0.20 kg CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). No response of forest-floor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to leaf area index or photosynthetic photon flux density was observed, suggesting a strong direct control of environmental factors and a weak or even lacking indirect control of canopy biology. Furthermore, the forest-floor was a consistent CH<sub>4</sub> sink (-19.1&plusmn;1.8 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), with annual fluxes driven mainly by snow depth. Fluxes during winter were less important for the CO<sub>2</sub> budget (6.0&ndash;7.3 %), while they contributed substantially to the annual CH<sub>4</sub> budget (14.4&ndash;18.4 %). N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were very low, negligible for the forest-floor GHG budget at our site. In 2022, the warmest year on record with also below-average precipitation at the Davos site, we observed a substantial increase in forest-floor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to other years. The mean forest-floor GHG budget indicated emissions of 2317&plusmn;200 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (mean&plusmn;standard deviation over four years), with CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes dominating and CH<sub>4</sub> offsetting a small proportion (0.8 %) of the GHG budget. Due to the relevance of snow cover, we recommend year-round measurements of GHG fluxes with high temporal resolution. In a future with increasing temperatures and less snow cover due to climate change, we expect increased forest-floor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions even at this subalpine site, with negative effects on its carbon sink behaviour.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Branched alkanes represent a significant proportion of hydrocarbons emitted in urban environments. To accurately predict the SOA budgets in urban environments, these branched alkanes should be considered as SOA precursors. However, the potential to form SOA from diverse branched alkanes under varying environmental conditions is currently not well understood. In this study, the Unified Partitioning Aerosol Phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model is extended to predict SOA formation via the multiphase reactions of various branched alkanes. Simulations with the UNIPAR model, which processes multiphase partitioning and aerosol phase reactions to form SOA, require a product distribution predicted from an explicit gas kinetic mechanism, whose oxygenated products are applied to create volatility-reactivity based lumping species array. Due to a lack of practically applicable explicit gas mechanisms, the prediction of the product distributions of various branched alkanes was approached with an innovative method that considers carbon lengths and branching structures. The lumping array of each branched alkane was primarily constructed using an existing lumping array of the linear alkane with the nearest vapor pressure. Generally, the vapor pressures of branched alkanes and their oxidation products are lower than those of linear alkanes with the same carbon length. In addition, increasing the branching of an alkane can also decrease the ability of alkanes to undergo autoxidation reactions that tend to form low-volatility products and significantly contribute to alkane SOA formation. To account for this, an autoxidation reduction factor, as a function of the degree and position of branching, was applied to the lumped groups which contain autoxidation products. The resulting product distributions were then applied to the UNIPAR model for predicting branched alkane SOA formation. The simulated SOA mass was compared to SOA data generated under varying experimental conditions (i.e., NO<sub>x</sub> levels, seed conditions, and humidity) in an outdoor photochemical smog chamber. Branched alkane SOA yields were significantly impacted by NO<sub>x</sub> levels but insignificantly impacted by seed conditions or humidity. The SOA formation from branched and linear alkanes in diesel fuel was simulated to understand the relative importance of branched and linear alkanes in a wide range of carbon numbers. Overall, branched alkanes account for more SOA mass than linear alkanes due to their higher contribution to diesel fuel. As anthropogenic emissions of hydrocarbons decrease, biogenic precursors tend to become increasingly important with regard to atmospheric organic aerosol. Unlike aromatics, which are almost exclusively sourced from anthropogenic emissions, alkanes can also be emitted from biogenic sources (i.e. plant wax) and they will remain a significant source of SOA.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:creator>Solomon, Amy</dc:creator>
      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) is being tested in standalone mode to identify biases that limit its suitability for seasonal prediction, where CICE is driven by atmospheric forcings from the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and a built-in mixed layer ocean model in CICE. The initial conditions for the sea ice and mixed layer ocean are also from CFSR in the control experiments. The simulated sea ice extent agrees well with observations during the warm season at all lead times up to 12 months, in both the Arctic and Antarctic. This suggests that CICE is able to provide useful sea ice edge information for seasonal prediction. However, the model&rsquo;s Arctic sea ice thickness forecast has a positive bias that originates from the initial conditions. This bias often persists for more than a season, which limits the model&rsquo;s seasonal forecast skill. To address this limitation, additional CS2_IC experiments were conducted, where the Arctic ice thickness was initialized using CryoSat-2 satellite observations while keeping all other initial fields the same as in the control experiments. This reduced the positive bias in the ice thickness in the initial conditions, leading to improvements in both the simulated ice edge and thickness at the seasonal time scale. This study highlights that the suitability of CICE for seasonal prediction depends on various factors, including initial conditions such as sea ice thickness, oceanic and atmospheric conditions in addition to sea ice coverage. By reducing the bias in the initial ice thickness, CICE has the potential to improve its seasonal forecast skill and provide more accurate predictions of sea ice extent and thickness.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>It has been well established that during the late Quaternary, the Khvalynian transgression of the Caspian Sea occurred, when the sea level rose tens of meters above the present one. Here, we evaluate the physical feasibility of the hypothesis that the maximum phase of this extraordinary event (known as the &ldquo;Early Khvalynian transgression&rdquo;) could be initiated and maintained for several thousand years solely by hydroclimatic factors. The hypothesis is based on recent studies dating the highest sea level stage (well above +10 m a.s.l.) to the final period of deglaciation, 17&ndash;13 kyr BP, and studies estimating the contribution of the glacial waters in the sea level rise for this period as negligible. To evaluate the hypothesis put forward, we first applied the coupled ocean and sea-ice general circulation model driven by the climate model and estimated the equilibrium water inflow (irrespective of its origin) sufficient to maintain the sea level at the well-dated marks of the Early Khvalynian transgression as 400&ndash;470 km<sup>3</sup>/year. Secondly, we conducted an extensive 14C-dating of the large paleochannels (signs of high flow of atmospheric origin) located in the Volga basin and found that the period of their origin (17.5&ndash;14 ka BP) is almost identical to the recent dating of the main phase of the Early Khvalynian transgression. Water flow that could form these palaeochannels was earlier estimated for the ancient Volga River as 420 km<sup>3</sup>/year, i.e. close to the equilibrium runoff we determined. Thirdly, we applied a hydrological model forced by paleoclimate data to reveal physically consistent mechanisms of an extraordinarily high water inflow into the Caspian Sea in the absence of visible glacial meltwater effect. We found that the inflow could be caused by the spread of post-glacial permafrost in the Volga paleo-catchment. The numerical experiments demonstrated that the permafrost resulted in a sharp drop in infiltration into the frozen ground and reduced evaporation, which all together generated the Volga runoff during the Oldest Dryas, 17&ndash;14.8 kyr BP, up to 360 km<sup>3</sup>/year (i.e. the total inflow into the Caspian Sea could reach 450 km<sup>3</sup>/year). The closeness of the estimates of river inflow into the sea, obtained by three independent methods, in combination with the previously obtained results, gave us reason to conclude that the hypothesis put forward is physically consistent.</p>]]></dc:description>

The simulations cover the period from 1420 to 2009. With 60 ensemble members between 1420 and 1850 and 36 ensemble members from 1850 to 2009, ModE-Sim consists of 31 620 simulated years in total. ModE-Sim is suitable for many applications as its various subsets can be used as initial-condition and boundary-condition ensembles to study climate variability. The main intention of this paper is to give a comprehensive description of the experimental setup of ModE-Sim and to provide an evaluation, mainly focusing on the two key variables, 2 m temperature and precipitation. We demonstrate ModE-Sim's ability to represent their mean state, to produce a reasonable response to external forcings, and to sample internal variability. Through the example of heat waves, we show that the ensemble is even capable of capturing certain types of extreme events.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The permeability of rock fractures is a crucial parameter for flow processes in the subsurface. In the last decades different methods were developed to investigate on permeability in fractures, such as flow through experiments, numerical flow simulations or empirical equations. In recent years, the topological method persistent homology was also used to estimate permeability in fracture networks and porous rocks, but not for rough single fractures. Hence, we apply persistent homology analysis on a decimeter-scale, rough sandstone bedding joint. To investigate on the influence of roughness, three different data sets are created to perform the analysis: (1) 200 &micro;m resolution, (2) 100 &micro;m resolution and (3) 50 &micro;m resolution. All estimated permeabilities were then compared to values derived by experimental air permeameter measurements and numerical flow simulation. The results reveal that persistent homology analysis is able to estimate the permeability of a single fracture even if it tends to slightly overestimate permeabilities compared to conventional methods. Previous studies using porous media showed the same overestimation trend. Furthermore, expenditure of time for persistent homology analysis as well as air permeameter measurements and numerical flow simulation was compared which showed that persistent homology analysis can be also an acceptable alternative for conventional methods in this regard.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Assessing past distributions, variability and trends in the mountain snow cover and its first-order drivers, temperature and precipitation, is key for a wide range of studies and applications. In this study, we compare the results of various modeling systems (global and regional reanalyses ERA5, ERA5-Land, ERA5-Crocus, CERRA-Land, UERRA MESCAN-SURFEX and MTMSI and regional climate model simulations CNRM-ALADIN and CNRM-AROME driven by the global reanalysis ERA-Interim) against observational references (in situ, gridded observational datasets and satellite observations) across the European Alps from 1950 to 2020. The comparisons are performed in terms of monthly and seasonal snow cover variables (snow depth and snow cover duration) and their main atmospherical drivers (near-surface temperature and precipitation). We assess multi-annual averages of regional and subregional mean values, their interannual variations, and trends over various timescales, mainly for the winter period (from November through April).</p>        <p>ERA5, ERA5-Crocus, MESCAN-SURFEX, CERRA-Land and MTMSI offer a satisfying description of the monthly snow evolution. However, a spatial comparison against satellite observation indicates that all datasets overestimate the snow cover duration, especially the melt-out date. CNRM-AROME and CNRM-ALADIN simulations and ERA5-Land exhibit an overestimation of the snow accumulation during winter, increasing with elevations.</p>        <p>The analysis of the interannual variability and trends  indicates that modeling snow cover dynamics remains complex across multiple scales and that none of the models evaluated here fully succeed to reproduce this compared to observational reference datasets. Indeed, while most of the evaluated model outputs perform well at representing the interannual to multi-decadal winter temperature and precipitation variability, they often fail to address the variability in  the snow depth and snow cover duration. We discuss several artifacts potentially responsible for incorrect long-term climate trends in several reanalysis products (ERA5 and MESCAN-SURFEX), which we attribute primarily to the heterogeneities of the observation datasets assimilated.</p>        <p>Nevertheless, many of the considered datasets in this study exhibit past trends in line with the current state of knowledge. Based on these datasets, over the last 50 years (1968–2017) at a regional scale, the European Alps have experienced a winter warming of 0.3 to 0.4 <span class="inline-formula"><sup>∘</sup></span>C per decade, stronger at lower elevations, and a small reduction in winter precipitation, homogeneous with elevation. The decline in the winter snow depth and snow cover duration ranges from <span class="inline-formula">−7</span> % to <span class="inline-formula">−15</span> % per decade and from <span class="inline-formula">−5</span> to <span class="inline-formula">−7</span> d per decade, respectively, both showing a larger decrease at low and intermediate elevations.</p>        <p>Overall, we show that no modeling strategy outperforms all others within our sample and that upstream choices (horizontal resolution, heterogeneity of the observations used for data assimilation in reanalyses, coupling between surface and atmosphere, level of complexity, configuration of the snow scheme, etc.) have great consequences on the quality of the datasets and their potential use. Despite their limitations, in many cases they can be used to characterize the main features of the mountain snow cover for a range of applications.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Groundwater is an essential part of the water supply worldwide, and the demands on this water source can be expected to increase in the future. To satisfy the need for resources and to ensure sustainable use of resources, increasingly detailed knowledge of groundwater systems is necessary. However, it is difficult to directly map groundwater with well-established geophysical methods as these are sensitive to both lithology and pore fluid. Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (SNMR) is the only method with a direct sensitivity to water, and it is capable of non-invasively quantifying water content and porosity in the subsurface. Despite these attractive features, SNMR has not been widely adopted in hydrological research, the main reason being an often-poor signal-to-noise ratio, which leads to long acquisition times and high uncertainty in terms of results. Recent advances in SNMR acquisition protocols based on a novel steady-state approach have demonstrated the capability of acquiring high-quality data much faster than previously possible. In turn, this has enabled high-density groundwater mapping with SNMR. We demonstrate the applicability of the new steady-state scheme in three field campaigns in Denmark, where more than 100 SNMR soundings were conducted with a depth of investigation of approximately 30 m. We show how the SNMR soundings enable us to track water level variations at the regional scale, and we demonstrate a high correlation between water levels obtained from SNMR data and water levels measured in boreholes. We also interpret the SNMR results jointly with independent transient electromagnetic (TEM) data, which allows us to identify regions with water bound in small pores. Field practice and SNMR acquisition protocols were optimized during the campaigns, and we now routinely measure high-quality data at 8 to 10 sites per day with a two-person field crew. Together, the results from the three surveys demonstrate that, with steady-state SNMR, it is now possible to map regional variations in water levels with high-quality data and short acquisition times.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Solid precipitation measurements in Antarctica are crucial as snowfall represents the main water input term for the polar cap, and its probable increase in the coming century can mitigate sea-level rise caused by global warming. This paper presents 7 years of Micro Rain Radar (Metek MRR-2) data at the Dumont d'Urville station in coastal Ad&eacute;lie Land, East Antarctica. Statistics are calculated on 3 radar variables (equivalent reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity and signal-to-noise ratio) to outline the main characteristics of the radar dataset. Seasonal and interannual variabilities are also investigated, but no significant temporal trends are detected except for the seasonal mean Doppler velocity which is higher in summer and lower in winter.</p> <p>We then use the snowfall rate (<em>S</em>) data from a colocated snow-gauge to estimate the MRR precipitation profile from the radar equivalent reflectivity (<em>Ze</em>) through a locally derived Ze-S relation. We find the relation Ze = 43.3 S<sup>0.88</sup>. The processing method used to obtain this relation, data quality and uncertainty considerations are discussed in the manuscript.</p> <p>In order to give an example of application of the dataset, a brief statistical comparison of the MRR precipitation rate along the vertical with model data from the ERA5 reanalysis and the LMDZ climate model is performed, and notably shows that models underestimate heavy precipitation events.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, has been losing mass at an accelerating rate over recent decades in response to enhanced oceanic forcing. Overlying the Aurora Subglacial Basin, it has been referred to as the “weak underbelly” of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and is drained by several major outlet glaciers. Despite their potential importance, few of these glaciers have been studied in detail. This includes the six outlet glaciers which drain into Vincennes Bay, a region recently discovered to have the warmest intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) ever recorded in East Antarctica. Here, we use satellite imagery; differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); and remotely sensed datasets of ice-surface velocity, ice-surface elevation and grounding line position to investigate ice dynamics between 1963 and 2022. Our results support previous observations of extensive grounding line retreat at Vanderford Glacier, measured at 18.6 km between 1996 and 2020. The persistent grounding line retreat, averaging 0.8 km yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span>, places Vanderford Glacier as the fastest retreating glacier in East Antarctica, and the third fastest in Antarctica, across decadal timescales. Such rapid retreat is consistent with the hypothesis that warm mCDW is able to access deep cavities formed below the Vanderford Ice Shelf, driving high rates of basal melting close to the grounding line. With a retrograde slope observed inland along the Vanderford Trench, such oceanic forcing may have significant implications for the future stability of Vanderford Glacier.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The light-absorbing organic aerosol (OA), known as brown carbon (BrC), has important radiative impacts; however, its sources and evolution after emission remain to be elucidated. In this study, the light absorption at multiple wavelengths, mass spectra of OA and microphysical properties of black carbon (BC) were characterized at a typical suburban environment in Beijing. The absorption of BC is constrained by its size distribution and mixing state, and the BrC absorption is obtained by subtracting the BC absorption from the total aerosol absorption. Aerosol absorption was further apportioned to BC, primary BrC and secondary BrC by applying the least correlation between secondary BrC and BC. The multilinear regression analysis on the factorized OA mass spectra indicated that the OA from traffic and biomass burning emission contributed to primary BrC. Importantly, the moderately oxygenated OA (O <span class="inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"><mo>/</mo></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="8pt" height="14pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="1b4178c77ca0d4bfee6c9ddd864f3a43"><svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-23-9439-2023-ie00001.svg" width="8pt" height="14pt" src="acp-23-9439-2023-ie00001.png"/></svg:svg></span></span> C <span class="inline-formula">=</span> 0.62) was revealed to highly correlate with secondary BrC.

The photochemical processes were found to reduce the mass absorption cross section (MAC) of primary OA, reducing its contribution to total absorption by 20 %, at the same time increasing MAC for secondary OA, which showed a 30 % enhancement in contribution to total absorbance, implying the concurrent whitening and darkening of BrC. This provides field evidence that the photochemically produced secondary nitrogen-containing OA can considerably compensate for some bleaching effect on the primary BrC, hereby causing radiative impacts.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Indole (<em>ind</em>) is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic volatile organic compound commonly emitted from animal husbandry and from different plants like maize with global emissions of 0.1 Tg y<sup>-1</sup>. The chemical composition and optical properties of indole secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and brown carbon (BrC) are still not well understood. To address this, environmental chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the oxidation of indole at atmospherically relevant concentrations of selected oxidants (OH radicals and O<sub>3</sub>) with/without NO<sub>2</sub>. In the presence of NO<sub>2</sub>, the SOA yields decreased by more than a factor of two but the mass absorption coefficient at 365 nm (<em>MAC</em><sub>365</sub>) of <em>ind</em>-SOA was 4.3 &plusmn; 0.4 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which was 5 times higher than that in experiments without NO<sub>2</sub>. In the presence of NO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (identified as 3-nitroindole) contributed 76 % to the all organic compounds detected by a chemical ionization mass spectrometer, contributing ~50 % of the light absorption at 365 nm (<em>Abs</em><sub>365</sub>). In the absence of NO<sub>2</sub>, the dominating chromophore was C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>3</sub>N contributing to 20&ndash;30 % of <em>Abs</em><sub>365</sub>. Indole contributes substantially to the formation of secondary BrC and its potential impact on the atmospheric radiative transfer is further enhanced in the presence of NO<sub>2</sub>, as it significantly increases the specific light absorption of <em>ind</em>-SOA by facilitating the formation of 3-nitroindole. This work provides new insights into an important process of brown carbon formation by interaction of two pollutants, NO<sub>2</sub> and indole, mainly emitted by anthropogenic activities.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Trifluoromethane (CHF<span class="inline-formula"><sub>3</sub></span>, HFC-23), one of the most potent greenhouse gases among hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), is mainly emitted to the atmosphere as a by-product in the production of the ozone-depleting legacy refrigerant and chemical feedstock chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span>, HCFC-22). A recent study on atmospheric observation-based global HFC-23 emissions (top-down estimates) showed significant discrepancies over 2014–2017 between the increase in the observation-derived emissions and the 87 % emission reduction expected from capture and destruction processes of HFC-23 at HCFC-22 production facilities implemented by national phase-out plans (bottom-up emission estimates) (Stanley et al., 2020). However, the actual regions responsible for the increased emissions were not identified. Here, we estimate the regional top-down emissions of HFC-23 for eastern Asia based on in situ measurements at Gosan, South Korea, and show that the HFC-23 emissions from eastern China have increased from <span class="inline-formula">5.0±0.4</span> Gg yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span> in 2008 to <span class="inline-formula">9.5±1.0</span> Gg yr<span class="inline-formula"><sup>−1</sup></span> in 2019. The continuous rise since 2015 was contrary to the large emissions reduction reported under the Chinese hydrochlorofluorocarbons production phase-out management plan (HPPMP). The cumulative difference between top-down and bottom-up estimates for 2015–2019 in eastern China was <span class="inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M7" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"><mrow><mo>∼</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">23.7</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">3.6</mn></mrow></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="60pt" height="10pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="5c3605c4168f85d728d34f3f1930e4b0"><svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-23-9401-2023-ie00001.svg" width="60pt" height="10pt" src="acp-23-9401-2023-ie00001.png"/></svg:svg></span></span> Gg, which accounts for <span class="inline-formula">47±11</span> % of the global mismatch. Our analysis based on HCFC-22 production information suggests the HFC-23 emissions rise in eastern China is more likely associated with known HCFC-22 production facilities rather than the existence of unreported, unknown HCFC-22 production, and thus observed discrepancies between top-down and bottom-up emissions could be attributed to unsuccessful factory-level HFC-23 abatement and inaccurate quantification of emission reductions.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Fine particulate matter (PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span>) pollution is still one of China's most important environmental issues, especially in northern cities during wintertime. In this study, intensive real-time measurement campaigns were conducted in Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, and Beijing to investigate the chemical characteristics and source contributions of PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span> and explore the formation of heavy pollution for policy implications. The chemical compositions of PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span> in the three cities were all dominated by organic aerosol (OA) and nitrate (NO<span class="inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M6" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"><mrow><msubsup><mi/><mn mathvariant="normal">3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></mrow></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="9pt" height="16pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="a6a4c5911a740e8377438efb607d4b86"><svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-23-9455-2023-ie00001.svg" width="9pt" height="16pt" src="acp-23-9455-2023-ie00001.png"/></svg:svg></span></span>). Results of source apportionment analyzed by a hybrid environmental receptor model (HERM) showed that the secondary formation source contributed more to PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span> compared to other primary sources. Biomass burning was the dominant primary source in the three pilot cities. The contribution of coal combustion to PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span> is non-negligible in Xi'an and Shijiazhuang but is no longer an important contributor in the capital city of Beijing due to the execution of a strict coal-banning policy. The potential formation mechanisms of secondary aerosol in the three cities were further explored by establishing the correlations between the secondary formation sources and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and <span class="inline-formula">O<sub><i>x</i></sub></span> <span class="inline-formula">(O<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>)</span>, respectively. The results showed that photochemical oxidation and aqueous-phase reaction were two important pathways of secondary aerosol formation. According to source variations, air pollution events that occurred in campaigns were classified into three types: biomass-combustion-dominated, secondary-formation-source-dominated, and a combination of primary and secondary sources. Additionally, this study compares the changes in chemical composition and source contributions of PM<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2.5</sub></span> in past decades. The results suggest that the clean-energy replacements for rural households should be urgently encouraged to reduce the primary source emissions in northern China, and collaborative control on ozone and particulate matter needs to be continuously promoted to weaken the atmosphere oxidation capacity for the sake of reducing secondary aerosol formation.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The hydrological system of Rift Valley Lakes in Ethiopia has recently experienced changes since the past two decades. Potential causes for these changes include anthropogenic, hydro-climatic and geological factors. The main objective of this study was to utilize an integrated methodology to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hydrological systems and potential driving factors within a complex and data-scarce region. To this end, we integrated a hydrologic model, change point analysis, indicators of hydrological alteration (IHA), and bathymetry survey to investigate hydrological dynamics and potential causes. A hydrologic model (SWAT+) was parameterized for the gauged watersheds and extended to the ungauged watersheds using multisite regionalization techniques. The SWAT+ model performed very good to satisfactory for daily streamflow in all watersheds with respect to the objective functions, Kling&ndash;Gupta efﬁciency (KGE), the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efﬁciency (NSE), Percent bias (PBIAS). The findings reveal notable changes of lake inflows and lake levels over the past two decades. Chamo Lake experienced an increase in area by 11.86 km&sup2;, in depth by 4.4 m, and in volume by 7.8 x 108 m&sup3;. In contrast, Lake Abijata witnessed an extraordinary 68% decrease in area and a depth decrease of 1.6 m. During the impact period, the mean annual rainfall experienced a decrease of 6.5% and 2.7% over the Abijata Lake and the Chamo Lake, respectively. Actual evapotranspiration decreased by 2.9% in Abijata Lake but increased by up to 0.5% in Chamo Lake. Surface inflow to Abijata Lake decreased by 12.5%, while Lake Chamo experienced an 80.5% increase in surface inflow. Sediment depth in Chamo Lake also increased by 0.6 m. The results highlight that the changing hydrological regime in Chamo Lake is driven by increased surface runoff and sediment intrusion associated with anthropogenic influences. The hydrological regime of Abijata Lake is affected by water abstraction from feeding rivers and lakes for industrial and irrigation purposes. This integrated methodology provides a holistic understanding of complex data scarce hydrological systems and potential driving factors in the Rift Valley Lakes in Ethiopia, which could have global applicability.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Layout design and wake steering through wind plant control are important and complex components in the design and operation of modern wind power plants. They are currently optimized separately, but with more and more computational and experimental studies demonstrating the gains possible through wake steering, there is a growing  need from industry and regulating bodies to combine the layout and control optimization in a co-design process. However, combining these two optimization problems is currently infeasible due to the excessive number of design variables and large solution space. In this article, we present a method that enables the coupled optimization of wind power plant layout and wake steering with no additional computational expense than a traditional layout optimization. We developed a geometric relationship between wind turbines to find an approximate optimal yaw angle, bypassing the need for either a nested or coupled wind plant control optimization. It also provides a significant and immediate improvement to wind power plant design by enabling the co-design of turbine layout and yaw control for wake steering. A small co-designed plant shown in this article produces 0.8 % more energy than its sequentially designed counterpart. This additional energy production comes with no additional infrastructure, turbine hardware, or control software; it is simply the outcome of optimizing the turbine layout and yaw control together, resulting in millions of dollars of additional revenue for the wind power plants of the future.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Stratospheric aerosols play important roles in Earth&rsquo;s radiative budget and in heterogeneous chemistry. Volcanic eruptions modulate the stratospheric aerosol layer by injecting particles and particle precursors like sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) into the stratosphere. Beginning on April 9th, 2021, La Soufri&egrave;re erupted injecting SO<sub>2</sub> into the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, yielding a peak SO<sub>2</sub> loading of 0.3&ndash;0.4 Tg. The resulting volcanic aerosol plumes dispersed predominately over the northern hemisphere (NH), as indicated by the CALIOP/CALIPSO satellite observations and model simulations. From June to August 2021 and May to July 2022, the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft extensively sampled the stratospheric aerosol layer over the continental United States during the Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) mission. These <em>in situ</em> aerosol measurements provide detailed insights into the number concentration, size distribution, and spatiotemporal variations of particles within volcanic plumes. Notably, aerosol surface area density and number density in 2021 were enhanced by a factor of 2&ndash;4 between 380&ndash;500 K potential temperature compared to the 2022 DCOTSS observations, which were minimally influenced by volcanic activity. Within the volcanic plume, the observed aerosol number density exhibited significant meridional and zonal variations while the mode and shape of aerosol size distributions did not vary. The La Soufri&egrave;re eruption led to an increase in the number concentration of small particles (&lt;400 nm), resulting in a smaller aerosol effective diameter during the summer of 2021 compared to the baseline conditions in the summer of 2022, as observed in regular ER-2 profiles over Salina, Kansas. A similar reduction in aerosol effective diameter was not observed in ER-2 profiles over Palmdale, California, possibly due to the already smaller values in that region during the limited sampling period in 2022. The La Soufri&egrave;re eruption was modeled with the SOCOL-AERv2 aerosol-chemistry-climate model. The modeled aerosol enhancement aligned well with DCOTSS observations, although the direct comparison was complicated by issues related to the model&rsquo;s background aerosol burden. This study indicates that the La Soufri&egrave;re eruption contributed at most 0.6 % to Arctic and Antarctic ozone column depletion in both 2021 and 2022, which is well within the range of natural variability. The modeled top-of-atmosphere one-year global average radiative forcing was -0.08 W/m<sup>2</sup> clear-sky and -0.04 W/m<sup>2</sup> all-sky. The radiative effects were concentrated in the tropics and NH midlatitudes and diminished to near-baseline levels after one year.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>The biological carbon pump is responsible for much of the decadal variability in the ocean carbon dioxide (CO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub>)</span> sink, driving the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. A mechanistic understanding of the ecological drivers of particulate organic carbon (POC) flux is key both to the assessment of the magnitude of the ocean CO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> sink and for accurate predictions as to how this will change with changing climate. This is particularly important in the Southern Ocean, a key region for the uptake of CO<span class="inline-formula"><sub>2</sub></span> and the supply of nutrients to the global thermocline. In this study we examine sediment-trap-derived particle fluxes and stable isotope signatures of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and biogenic silica (BSi) at a study site in the biologically productive waters of the northern Scotia Sea in the Southern Ocean. Both deep (2000 m) and shallow (400 m) sediment traps exhibited two main peaks in POC, particulate N, and BSi flux: one in austral spring and one in summer, reflecting periods of high surface productivity. Particulate fluxes and isotopic compositions were similar in both deep and shallow sediment traps, highlighting that most remineralisation occurred in the upper 400 m of the water column. Differences in the seasonal cycles of isotopic compositions of C, N, and Si provide insights into the degree of coupling of these key nutrients. We measured increasing isotopic enrichment of POC and BSi in spring, consistent with fractionation during biological uptake. Since we observed isotopically light particulate material in the traps in summer, we suggest physically mediated replenishment of lighter isotopes of key nutrients from depth, enabling the full expression of the isotopic fractionation associated with biological uptake. The change in the nutrient and remineralisation regimes, indicated by the different isotopic compositions of the spring and summer productive periods, suggests a change in the source region of material reaching the traps and associated shifts in phytoplankton community structure. This, combined with the occurrence of advective inputs at certain times of the year, highlights the need to make synchronous measurements of physical processes to improve our ability to track changes in the source regions of sinking particulate material. We also highlight the need to conduct particle-specific (e.g. faecal pellets, phytoplankton detritus, zooplankton moults) isotopic analysis to improve the use of this tool in assessing particle composition of the sinking material and to develop our understanding of the drivers of biogeochemical fluxes.</p>]]></dc:description>

      <dc:description><![CDATA[<p>Current methods for detecting atmospheric plumes and inferring point source rates from high-resolution satellite imagery are labor intensive and not scalable to the growing satellite dataset available for methane point sources. Here we present a two-step algorithm called U-Plume for automated detection and quantification of point sources from satellite imagery. The first step delivers plume detection and delineation (masking) with a machine learning U-Net architecture for image segmentation. The second step quantifies point source rate from the masked plume using wind speed information and either a convolution neural network (CNN) or a physics-based Integrated Mass Enhancement (IME) method. The algorithm can process 62 128&times;128 images per second on a single core. We train the algorithm with large-eddy simulations of methane plumes superimposed on noisy and variable methane background scenes from the GHGSat-C1 satellite instrument. We introduce the concept of point source observability <em>O<sub>ps</sub></em> = <em>Q</em>/(<em>UW</em>&Delta;<em>B</em>) as a single dimensionless number to predict plume detectability and source rate quantification error from an instrument as a function of source rate <em>Q</em>, wind speed <em>U</em>, instrument pixel size <em>W</em>, and instrument-dependent background noise &Delta;<em>B</em>. We show that <em>O<sub>ps</sub></em> can powerfully diagnose the ability of an imaging instrument to observe point sources of a certain magnitude under given conditions. U-Plume successfully detects and masks plumes from sources as small as 100 kg h<sup>-1</sup> over surfaces with low background noise and succeeds for larger point sources over surfaces with substantial background noise. We find that the IME method for source quantification is unbiased over the full range of source rates while the CNN method is biased toward the mean of its training range. The total error in source rate quantification is dominated by wind speed at low wind speeds and by the masking algorithm at high wind speeds. A wind speed of 2&ndash;4 m s<sup>-1</sup> is optimal for detection and quantification of point sources from satellite data.</p>]]></dc:description>
